        <p>'…I should probably take my leave.'</p><p>As Edward and Natasha stood by the door in silence, I took this moment to finally enter my house.</p><p>Didn't want to get in between the reunion of the two.</p><p>As I stepped into the house, my body unknowingly began to relax. It was the same old corridor, the same old smell, the familiar voices in the distance, everything was the same as it had been before.</p><p>A thin smile spread across my face as I took out my shoes and placed them on the shoe rack.</p><p>Afterward, my shoulders stiffened a bit, but I still gathered the courage to walk into the living room.</p><p>It was now or never.</p><p>...and, just as I managed to gather my courage, a familiar figure emerged from the kitchen and met my gaze.</p><p>"Did something happen to Natasha? It's taking her—"</p><p>Both of our feet came to a stop as we stared at each other. At that moment, silence enveloped the corridors of the house as neither one of us spoke.</p><p>'She looks the same as always...'</p><p>As she wore a nice blue apron, my mother looked exactly as she did half a year ago with her blonde hair falling to the right side of her shoulders that perfectly complimented her blue eyes.</p><p>Her deep blue eyes, which bore a striking resemblance to mine, scrutinized my body carefully as a variety of emotions flashed across them.</p><p>I could definitely feel hints of anger coming from her, but above all else, I could feel the relief in them as she looked at me.</p><p>Breaking the uncomfortable silence, I waved my hand in the air and smiled awkwardly.</p><p>"I..it's been a while mom. How have you been?"</p><p>"…"</p><p>As she stared at me, I was only met with deep silence.</p><p>After a while, wiping her hands on her apron, she subtly nodded her head.</p><p>"You're back…"</p><p>Her voice sounded rather monotonous. I inwardly groaned when I heard the tone of her voice.</p><p>With her head raised, she nudged me.</p><p>"…What happened to your hair? Did you dye it? A new style?"</p><p>"Ehm…"</p><p>I started to scratch the back of my head.</p><p>'How should I explain this…'</p><p>I definitely couldn't tell her that this was a result of my body suffering a trauma due to accessing a power that was far above mine…</p><p>"Circumstances happened…"</p><p>In the end that was all that I could mutter. Although I could've lied about my circumstances, I decided against it and just decided to be vague.</p><p>My mother was a living lie detector. There was no point in lying.</p><p>"…Okay."</p><p>In the same apathetic manner as before, she turned to the kitchen. Before entering the kitchen, I was able to hear her last words.</p><p>"Go and take a shower. Dinner will be ready in half an hour."</p><p>Staring at her disappearing back, I raised my armpits and smelled them.</p><p>"Ugh…"</p><p>My head recoiled back as I thought.</p><p>'I really do stink.'</p><p>"Haa..."</p><p>Letting out an exhausted sigh, I proceeded to head for my room. But just before I did so, I stopped by in the living room to greet my father and Nola.</p><p>After turning right in the living room, I noticed the two sitting together on the sofa.</p><p>As Nola scooted close to dad, she pointed at the screen of the tablet he was holding. Her eyes were filled with curiosity.</p><p>"Why did he jump the fence?"</p><p>"Because it is quicker this way."</p><p>"But isn't that naughty?"</p><p>"Very naughty."</p><p>As I listened to their conversations, I couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"Aren't the two of you going to greet me?"</p><p>At that moment, both heads snapped in my direction, and we looked each other in the eye.</p><p>The first to react was Nola as she jumped out of the sofa with an excited look on her face.</p><p>"Broth—!"</p><p>But halfway through her sentence, as though she recalled something, the excitement on her face disappeared and she sat back on the sofa with her arms crossed.</p><p>"Hmph."</p><p>She then turned her head and snorted.</p><p>"W…what?"</p><p>The sight left me shocked as I felt something pierce my heart. Moving up to her, I poked her little arms.</p><p>"Nola? Nola?"</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>But no matter what I did, she would repeatedly turn her head and avoid making eye contact with me.</p><p>The sight of her reaction made me once again feel a piercing pain run through my heart as I started shaking her body.</p><p>"Hey, hey, Nola, it's me. Your big brother. I know my hair has changed but it's still me.."</p><p>"Hmph."</p><p>"Don't do this to me…"</p><p>As I circled around Nola in an attempt to meet her gaze, my father's voice echoed out.</p><p>"Just leave her be for now."</p><p>"...Okay."</p><p>In the end, worried that she might twist her neck, I decided to stop.</p><p>But the damage was already done as I gazed at my father in hopes of receiving some support.</p><p>"This is on you."</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't seem too keen on helping me as he shook his head. Raising his head, he patted me on the shoulder.</p><p>"It's good that your back, but you best listen to your mother. Go and take a shower."</p><p>"…Alright."</p><p>With my shoulders slumped, I turned to glance at Nola. For a brief moment of time, our eyes met, but she quickly turned her head and crossed her arms.</p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p>"Ah…"</p><p>'No one loves me anymore.'</p><p>As I lowered my head, I headed to the bathroom to take a shower. Before that, I took a spare change of clothes.</p><p>Clank—</p><p>Closing the door behind me, I ended up muttering.</p><p>"I'm never doing this again…"</p><p>***</p><p>Edward lived over fifteen years believing that his wife had died protecting him and their daughter.</p><p>Fifteen years.</p><p>For a human, fifteen years was a frighteningly long time despite the increase in life expectancy.</p><p>He had long come to terms with his wife's death.</p><p>But…</p><p>Deeply staring into Natasha's eyes, Edward finally realized that she wasn't dead.</p><p>She was still alive, and she had just come back.</p><p>Seeing the tears that were dripping down her cheeks, a smile soon formed on his face.</p><p>"You look the same as the last time I've seen you…"</p><p>She truly did…</p><p>With her lustrous black hair, crystal clear eyes, and a look that would leave anyone speechless, she would be the envy of anyone who saw her.</p><p>It was the same as in the past.</p><p>Laying eyes on the woman in front of him, Edward was hit by a sudden wave of nostalgia as he couldn't help but think of the old days.</p><p>Back when he still had her.</p><p>He had thought that those days would've never ended.</p><p>Who would've known what the future held for them?</p><p>Had he known, he would've tried his best to stop whatever was going to happen. Alas, he knew that this was merely something he could only dream about and never accomplish.</p><p> "Y..you too."</p><p>As Natasha nodded her head, tears started streaming from her eyes.</p><p>"Yo..u also haven't changed."</p><p>"You think so?"</p><p>Staring at his clothes, Edward embarrassingly scratched the back of his head.</p><p>"I didn't know that you were going to be here. If I did, I would've opted for better clothes."</p><p>Wiping the tears from her eyes, Natasha's eyes fell on his clothes.</p><p>"I think they are fine as is."</p><p>Carefully taking a step forward, her hand trembled as she reached out for his top button.</p><p>"…But you forgot to button this one up."</p><p>While fixing his top button, neither of them blushed. They just felt it was natural. It was as if this were the way things were supposed to be.</p><p>"Done."</p><p>Once she was done, Natasha took a step back and weakly smiled.</p><p>"You look much better."</p><p>After staring at her for a couple of seconds, Edward realized they were in the middle of a corridor.</p><p>Thinking for a moment, Natasha looked behind her. Wiping her eyes, she looked back at Edward.</p><p>"Seeing as we still have some time before Amanda arrives, why don't I show you what your daughter has been up to?"</p><p>As soon as Amanda's name was mentioned, Edward's face changed and he lowered his head.</p><p>"…It's all my fault."</p><p>"It's alright."</p><p>Caressing his cheek with her hand, Natasha raised her voice.</p><p>"Samantha, I'll be going back to my room for a couple of minutes."</p><p>Several seconds later, Samantha replied.</p><p>"Don't worry about it. It will still take ten more minutes before dinner is ready. Take your time."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Glancing in Edward's way, Natasha headed for her room.</p><p>"Come, I'll show you what your daughter has been up to all these years."</p><p>***</p><p>'I'm tired.'</p><p>Amanda thought as she pressed the elevator button. Immediately after pushing the elevator button, she felt a pushing sensation coming from beneath her teeth.</p><p>"I hope they will like this…"</p><p>Currently, she was holding a pie made by the guild's chef. Apparently, it was a rare delicacy that only a very few could taste as the milk came from a very rare breed of monster that could only be found in certain areas of the human domain.</p><p>Because Amanda wasn't much of an eater, she didn't know how good it was. In spite of this, she knew that Nola loved sweets and that this would probably score some points with her.</p><p>Thinking of Nola, Amanda smiled.</p><p>Ding—!</p><p>Upon reaching the top floor, the elevator chimed and the doors opened.</p><p>Knowing the place like the back of her hand, Amanda soon arrived in front of Ren's apartment and rang the bell.</p><p>Ding— Dong—</p><p>Immediately after she rang, the door opened and she was greeted by Samantha's large smile.</p><p>"Amanda, you're just in time."</p><p>"This is for you."</p><p>Smiling back at her, Amanda handed her the cake.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>Surprise flashed across Samantha's face as she stared at the cake.</p><p>"A cake? How sweet of you. Let me quickly put it in the fridge."</p><p>Extending her hands, she took the cake.</p><p>"What are you waiting for Amanda? Come in, make yourself at home."</p><p>"If you will excuse me…"</p><p>Entering the apartment, Amanda took off her heels and placed them on the shoe rack beside her. Just as she was about to close the shoe rack, she suddenly heard the sound of rushed footsteps heading her way.</p><p>"Sister!"</p><p>Before Amanda knew it, Nola had already arrived before her and lunged her body in her direction.</p><p>Any normal person would've been caught off guard by Nola's sudden actions. But Amanda wasn't.</p><p>Extending her hands, she quickly caught Nola.</p><p>"Nola!"</p><p>"Heheheh."</p><p>Snuggling in Amanda's chest, Nola giggled. Then, recalling something, Nola tugged at Amanda's clothing.</p><p>Leaving Amanda's embrace, Nola urged Amanda to follow her.</p><p>"Come!"</p><p>"Hm? You want me to follow you?"</p><p>"Un!"</p><p>Though confused, Amanda followed Nola all the way toward the other end of the house before stopping at a certain room.</p><p>'Isn't this Ren's room?'</p><p>Recognizing the room, Amanda looked at Nola in confusion.</p><p>"Why did you bring me here?"</p><p>Knock— knock—</p><p>Instead of answering her, Nola knocked on the door, much to Amanda's confusion.</p><p>Within two seconds of the door knocking, the door opened, revealing a topless figure whose lower body was covered by a towel, and droplets of water flowed down his nearly perfect body.</p><p>With his right hand holding onto a towel to dry his hair, he blinked a couple of times before asking.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>Amanda's body froze completely.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-539.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-541.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

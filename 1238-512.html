        <p>Clank—! </p><p>"Follow me." </p><p>Coming out of my cell, I followed a demon out.</p><p>Everything happened out of nowhere. I was just quietly relaxing in my cell, and before I knew it, a demon came to my room and called out for me. </p><p>I was quite clueless about where I was going, but I decided not to say anything and just followed along. </p><p>There was no point in asking questions that I would not get an answer to. </p><p>That, and...</p><p>The fact that I already had an idea of what was going on. </p><p>'This might actually be a good chance for me...' </p><p>Glancing toward my left and right, as I followed the guard, I realized that the security was fairly lax. </p><p>There didn't seem to be many demons patrolling the area, and to make matters even stranger was the fact that my mane wasn't sealed. </p><p>It had to be noted that the demon in front of me was ranked lower than me. If I wanted to, I could kill him with a simple slap. </p><p>Not that I had any plans on doing that since I had a goal in mind. </p><p>Finding Amanda's dad. </p><p>Furthermore, I was sure that the security-only looked lax. In reality, it was probably extremely tight. Had this not been the case, many of the prisoners would've long escaped. </p><p>Tok. Tok. </p><p>The steady and calm of our footsteps echoed throughout the corridors. The corridors were pretty badly maintained as I could see cracks everywhere. Not only that, but they were also quite narrow, forcing me to move sideways sometimes. </p><p>To make matters worse, lingering in the air was an old and stuffy smell. </p><p>"We're here." </p><p>Walking for who knows long, we soon stopped in front of a large metallic door. Standing beside the door were a couple of demons. </p><p>With a simple nod, the demon walked toward the door. </p><p>To Tok—! </p><p>He then proceeded to knock on the door. </p><p>For the first couple of seconds, he was met with no response. However, this did not last for long as the door soon started to open. </p><p>Clank—! </p><p>Once the door was half-opened, I was finally able to catch a glimpse of what was behind it. </p><p>A luxuriously decorated room that far contrasted the shabby room I was previously staying in. A nice red carpet blanked the floor, and all sorts of decorations appeared in the room. From sofas to paintings and other things that would make one drool at the sight. </p><p>'So this is how the top rankers live...' </p><p>Gazing at the room for a bit, my line of sight paused on a few individuals inside the room. After a quick look, I was able to assess that they were the top rankers of the Duke bracket. </p><p>It was hard not to notice them. The pressure that their bodies emitted was quite frightening. It was at a level where I needed to take them seriously if I wanted to win. </p><p>Not that I showed it outwardly as I kept a straight face and stepped into the room. </p><p>The moment I stepped into the room, I felt everyone's gazes pause on me, carefully scrutinizing every part of my body. Not bothered by them, I calmly walked toward where the sofas were and leisurely sat down. </p><p>Crossing my legs and leaning back, I opened my mouth. </p><p>"So..." </p><p>I looked at everyone in the room. </p><p>"What did you guys want to talk about?"</p><p>"..." </p><p>Silence. </p><p>No one in the room said a word as they continued to stare in my direction. </p><p>It was then that someone finally spoke up. </p><p>"This human seems to be quite cocky." </p><p>Standing just at about four feet in height with a long ginger beard was a dwarf. Raising his brow he took a step forward and calmly analyzed my body. </p><p>"Herr...Herr...not bad." </p><p>Extending his hand, he presented himself. </p><p>"I'm SteamPunk, Rank five in the bracket." </p><p>"White Reaper, Rank thirty in the bracket." </p><p>I shook his hand back. As I did, I suddenly smelt a foul order coming from the dwarf. </p><p>'His breath stinks.' </p><p>Moving my head back, I tried my best to not make any strange faces. His breath was simply atrocious. </p><p>"White Reaper." </p><p>It was then that a soft voice called out for me. Turning my head, I found an elven lady staring in my direction. She had a rather long scar tracing down her face, and I could feel hints of insanity in her eyes. Her hair was a mixture of gold and silver, and if not for her scar, she would've looked extremely beautiful. </p><p>I stared straight into her eyes. </p><p>"You are?" </p><p>"Rank two, Silvermoon." </p><p>She replied in a disinterested tone. </p><p>"...Do you know why we've called you here?" </p><p>"Somewhat." </p><p>I answered. She nodded her head. The other people in the room became even more apprehensive as the room became tense. </p><p>"If you know why we've called you, then what do you think? Will you join our group?" </p><p>I smiled. </p><p>'Group, huh?' </p><p>I had already been briefed by my other self about what this group was all about. It was essentially a group that 'Maintained ranks' by fixing matches. </p><p>The purpose of this was so that they could monopolize all the top ten spots, and support the current Emperor rank. In short, everyone here was his lackey. </p><p>Before I had a chance to respond, she took a step to the side and extended her hand. </p><p>"We've seen your potential, don't let it rot in this place. Only if you join a group like ours can you have the chance to become an Overlord-level contender." </p><p>Her words were filled with conviction and resoluteness. Had I not been warned beforehand, I might've even been tempted by her words. </p><p>"Oh..." </p><p>I gave her a half-hearted reply. </p><p>The face of the elf changed when she noticed the tone of my reply, and the room became even tenser. </p><p>"You don't seem excited by this. Do you by chance happen to know that once you become an Overlord-level contender you can gain freedom?" </p><p>"I do."</p><p>I nodded. </p><p>Of course, I did. </p><p>This was something that was told to me on the very first day that I was here. All participants were told this. </p><p>With them having a goal in mind, the games would be a lot more entertaining to watch. </p><p>"If you know, then why do you look so disinterested. Are you perhaps not keen on the idea of freedom, or..." </p><p>Her eyes squinted and a powerful pressure sprung out from her body before heading in my direction. </p><p>"...are you just not interested in joining us?" </p><p>Because her actions were sudden, I was caught off-guard a bit. Even then, I retained a passive and nonchalant look on my face. </p><p>Glancing around the room and seeing everyone staring at me with bloodthirsty looks, I leaned back on the sofa and calmly asked. </p><p>"What do you want me to do?" </p><p>The pressure coming out from SilverMoon instantly disappeared. A smile soon replaced her previous scowl. </p><p>"Much better." </p><p>She muttered in a satisfied tone. Clasping her hands together, she cut straight to the chase. </p><p>"Lose your next game." </p><p>"Hm?" </p><p>I leaned my head forward a little. </p><p>"Lose my next game?" </p><p>"That's correct." </p><p>Turning her head, her eyes paused on a certain individual standing not so far from where I was. Turning my head, my eyes paused on a towering figure. </p><p>'He's big...' </p><p>I had already noticed him from the moment that I had entered the room, but now that I took a closer look at him, there was this sense of dread coming out from his body that made one shiver. </p><p>In contrast to the others in the room, the bloodthirsty aura coming out of his body was far greater. </p><p>"Skull Crusher." </p><p>I mumbled underneath my breath. I would only have to be a fool to not have been able to recognize him. </p><p>The aura that was coming out of his body was simply terrifying. Even for me, it was quite pressurizing. It felt as though I was back in Issanor, in the presence of the orc's number one contender, Kimor. </p><p>Overhearing my words, the SilverMoon smiled. </p><p>"It looks like you've recognized him." </p><p>Walking next to the orc, she patted him on the shoulder. </p><p>"Rank ten, Skull Crusher. Your next opponent, and someone who you will lose to in the next round." </p><p>"I don't need this." </p><p>Slapping the elven lady's hand off, Skull Crusher glared in my direction. </p><p>"I don't need him to purposely lose in our next match. I can easily get rid of a fly like him." </p><p>"You may be right, but rules are rules." </p><p>She turned to look in my direction. </p><p>"...I'm telling you for your own good. If you're interested in ever becoming free, then this is your only chance." </p><p>Raising and lowering her head to scrutinize me carefully, her brows knit for a couple of seconds. She then warned. </p><p>"You seem quite strong, but like Skull Crusher said, any one of us in the room is enough to crush you. It is in your best interest to join us." </p><p>After a while, she extended her hand in my direction. Her face was filled with confidence when she said those words. </p><p>"So what do you say, will you join us?" </p><p>Staring at her extended branch, I softly muttered. </p><p>"Tempting..." </p><p>The elven lady's smile brightened. </p><p>"That great—" </p><p>Cutting her off, I smirked. The faces of everyone changed the moment I did so. </p><p>But I did not care. </p><p>Placing my hand on the sofa, I slowly stood up. Then, turning around, I waved my hand and made my way out of the room. </p><p>"Thank you for your offer, but I will have to refuse. As if I'd join a group of people that I will eventually have to discard in the near future." </p><p>Following my words, I headed out of the room. </p><p>Since contestants could only fight each other in the arena, I wasn't worried about them trying anything in the meantime. </p><p>Exiting the room, I nudged the demon that had brought me with my head. </p><p>"Let's go." </p><p>*** </p><p>Clank—! </p><p>Once the door closed, a heavy silence descended on the room. Apart from the elven lady, none of the faces of the people in the room changed. </p><p>They didn't seem to particularly care. </p><p>"I see..." </p><p>SilverMoon darkly scanned the room. Turning her attention toward Skull Crusher, she coldly ordered. </p><p>"Make sure you let him know his place tomorrow. Take your time. Make him understand the consequences of his actions." </p><p>"Krrr...Krrr...I would've done this even if you hadn't told me." </p><p>Skull Crusher replied while clenching and unclenching his fists. A cruel and bloodthirsty smile hung on his lips. </p><p>"Good." </p><p>Taking a look at the other people in the room, she turned around and headed out of the room. </p><p>Clank—! </p><p>Closing the door behind her, she turned right and headed deeper down the corridor. Following her from behind was a demon. </p><p>Walking for the next couple of minutes, she eventually stopped in front of another door. </p><p>Tok—! </p><p>She knocked once. </p><p>The metallic echo of her knock reverberated throughout the corridor. A soft and gentle voice followed the knock. </p><p>"Come in." </p><p>"If you will excuse me." </p><p>Extending her hand, she opened the door.</p><p>Clank—! </p><p>Upon opening the door, she was presented with a similarly decorated room to the one that she was previously in. </p><p>However, if there was a difference between the two, it would have to be the fact that there was less furniture in this room. </p><p>Taking a couple of steps into the room, she soon stopped. It wasn't because she wanted to, but it was because she couldn't. Raising her head, her line of sight fell toward a figure that sat crossed-legged in the middle of the room with his bare back facing her. His silver hair descended down his back, and a terrifying pressure bore down on the area next to him. </p><p>After a brief moment of silence, the figure spoke. </p><p>"How did it go?" </p><p>"...He rejected the offer." </p><p>SilverMoon darkly said. Clenching her teeth, she added. </p><p>"He completely dismissed us. Treating us as a joke." </p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p>The figure in the middle of the room softly said. For a brief moment of time, the elven lady felt a cold chill run down her spine as she weakly nodded her head. </p><p>"Y...yes." </p><p>"I understand." </p><p>Lowering his hands, the figure slowly turned around. His eyes soon met SilverMoon's, and her body froze all over. A huge sense of dread that she had never felt before washed over her body. </p><p>"...You know what to do." </p><p>"Y...yes." </p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-511.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-513.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

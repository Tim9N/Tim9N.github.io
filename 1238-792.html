        <p>I knew that whatever lay ahead would be a stark contrast to how I had left it back then. But nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to witness.</p><p>"Holy fuck."</p><p>The words escaped my lips before I could even think to stop them. I couldn't think of anything to say, so I turned to look at Brutus, who was standing next to me and noticed that he had the same expression as I had.</p><p>Or at least, thought I had.</p><p>"What is this?"</p><p>He asked, his voice filled with what could only be described as shock.</p><p>Knowing that I wasn't the only one feeling this sense of shock, I grinned.</p><p>'It's nice to know that I'm not shocked just because I'm biased.'</p><p>I pressed my hand against his shoulder and took in the view in front of me.</p><p>"This, my friend, is Immorra."</p><p>While muttering those words, my breath caught in my throat, and my heart started racing. Although I had just recently communicated with Silug and had even made the others go to Immorra, I never actually went there myself.</p><p>I hadn't stepped foot in the place yet.</p><p>This was the first time in a very long time that I had visited this place, and the sheer magnitude of everything that was in front of me was so overwhelming that I could not help but stare in disbelief.</p><p>'The barrier looks sturdy as well.'</p><p>A shimmering energy barrier that radiated an otherworldly hue encircled the city. When I reached out with my hand to touch it, a faint ripple spread throughout.</p><p>'It can definitely hold out well against a Duke rank.'</p><p>I wasn't too sure about Prince Rank.</p><p>I had to test it.</p><p> 'Still, what's more impressive is the city…' </p><p>The towering skyscrapers that stood at the heart of Immorra were sleek and shiny, their surfaces reflecting the neon lights that illuminated the streets below.</p><p>But it wasn't just the buildings that caught my eye.</p><p>The streets were bustling with activity, with orcs, elves, and dwarves all going about their business. I watched in amazement as they moved about their day, their lives intertwined in a way that I had never seen before.</p><p>And then there were the trees.</p><p>'...My god.'</p><p>They encircled some of the buildings, and some were just as tall as the skyscrapers themselves. Their leaves rustled gently in the breeze, and I couldn't help but marvel at the sight.</p><p>Further into the city, the buildings became taller and more imposing, their architecture a testament to the ingenuity of the city's engineers and designers.</p><p>'This really the same place?'</p><p>I couldn't help but marvel at the sheer scale of it all.</p><p>But it wasn't just the buildings that impressed me.</p><p>The most striking feature of the city was the imposing city walls that encircled it. Made of reinforced steel and towering high into the sky, the walls were rather imposing.</p><p>"This is definitely a nice improvement over what they were before..."</p><p>I couldn't help but feel a sense of security as I gazed up at them, knowing that they were protecting the city from any potential threats.</p><p>And then, as if to further solidify the fact that this was no longer the same Immorra of my memories…</p><p>I felt it.</p><p>"Mana"</p><p>It was thin, but it was there.</p><p>Layers of it lingered in the air, and I could feel its power coursing through me. And then, as if that wasn't enough, I caught sight of several psyons floating in the air above me.</p><p>"They actually did it."</p><p>I muttered to myself, in awe of what I was witnessing.</p><p>A while back, Jomnuk told me that the elves knew of a way to create mana.</p><p>I hadn't put much thought into it at the time, but now I realize just how significant this was.</p><p>The fact that they had managed to create a city that was alive with mana was beyond what I had expected, and it filled me with a sense of wonder.</p><p>"It's still on the thin side, but it's here..."</p><p>I whispered to myself, unable to tear my gaze away from the city before me.</p><p>For a moment, I was lost in my thoughts, my mind racing with all of the possibilities that this city held.</p><p>And then, as if to snap me out of my reverie, I heard the soft flap of a pair of wings.</p><p>"Y,you're finally here."</p><p>"Suriol."</p><p>When I turned my gaze, my eyes paused on a familiar demon, and my eyes opened up a bit. As soon as I looked at the demon in front of me, the shock that I had previously felt from the city vanished almost instantly.</p><p>The state in which he was in.</p><p>It… It wasn't good.</p><p>He appeared to be very shriveled, and even standing in front of me appeared to be a challenge for him. When I looked at him, a variety of conflicting feelings flooded over me, and I decided to approach him.</p><p>"It looks like you've had it rough."</p><p>He gave me a sour smile but didn't say a word. It seemed like speaking was too much of a hurdle for him in his present state. He eyed me with some trepidation.</p><p>"H.. have you?"</p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p>I patted him on the shoulder and looked at the city.</p><p>"You've done a good job. It's right that you get what I promised you. Here."</p><p>When I removed the core that belonged to Prince Kuzma, Suriol's expression changed immediately and became more upbeat.</p><p>"T,thank you!"</p><p>He took the core from my hand and hastily brought it to his mouth.</p><p>A change took place almost instantaneously, and the atmosphere all around us became thick with demonic energy.</p><p>It didn't take long for Suriol's emaciated body to start making a full recovery, and his eyes, which only a few moments ago appeared to be cloudy, made a speedy recovery.</p><p>During the time that this was going on, I whirled around to face Brutus. His eyes flashed me an expression of sudden comprehension, and he nodded his head in my direction.</p><p>I nodded back.</p><p>'It looks like there won't be any problems.'</p><p>Good.</p><p>"Hahahaha."</p><p>A boisterous and cheerful laugh brought me back, and when I turned my head, I witnessed Suriol jumping up and down with joy, laughing like a maniac.</p><p>"…"</p><p>It was a sight that made it difficult for me to find the right words to describe it, and even Brutus was rendered speechless by his behavior.</p><p>But the demon in question didn't seem to care as he flapped his wings and flew into the air.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>His speed was extremely fast, and not only did he seem to be a lot faster than the last time that I fought him, but it also seemed as though his strength had undergone a significant transformation.</p><p>"Oh? Congratulations on your breakthrough."</p><p>I broke into a grin as soon as I realized what had taken place, and Suriol materialized in front of me not long after. His demeanor as a whole had altered, but the sparkle in his eyes was just as strong as before.</p><p>"Thank you…"</p><p>His gaze…</p><p>He almost seemed touched at the moment, and I found that rather amusing to see.</p><p>"For a very long time, I've been attempting to work my way up to the Prince rank... I tried all sorts of methods to get there, but none of them were successful."</p><p>Duke, no, Prince Suriol stared right at me as he continued.</p><p>"I had almost given up hope when I was brought to this planet to look out over it, but who could have predicted that I would eventually be able to get there after nearly dying?"</p><p>"What can I say? The diligent get rewarded."</p><p>Just before I sent Silug and his army to earth, I had a conversation with him, and during that conversation, he informed me of all of the contributions that Suriol had made.</p><p>He detailed to me how Suriol had taken charge of the administrative matters of the city and handled everything to the greatest possible extent.</p><p>'Who would've thought it was by this much?'</p><p>Initially, I didn't give it much thought and just wanted to thank him for his hard work, but after I saw the condition of the city, I realized that the reward I had given him was probably not enough after what he had done to the city.</p><p>I was honestly extremely pleased with the result.</p><p>"I'm very pleased with your work. Keep up the good work, and I'll think of giving you another reward."</p><p>I flashed Prince Plintus's core at him, and Suriol's expression hardened.</p><p>"You… you have another one?"</p><p>I smiled at him.</p><p>"Just do as you're told."</p><p>"O,okay."</p><p>Silug nodded with a stiff face.</p><p>'Good.'</p><p>I didn't just flash him the core for the sake of making him work harder.</p><p>It was also a warning to him.</p><p>A warning that Prince ranked demons were not something that I couldn't handle anymore. I believed he was going to be faithful to me, but several events that transpired in my life taught me not to put too much faith in anyone besides a select few.</p><p>If any.</p><p>"Ah, right!"</p><p>Suriol pounded his closed fist against the surface of his open palm as if suddenly recalling something important.</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>I asked, curious about his sudden behavior.</p><p>Looking at me, Suriols' wings expanded.</p><p>"Wait here for a moment. I've got something to report."</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>His figure disappeared from where he was standing, and the area around me turned quiet. Staring in the direction of where he was headed, I turned around to look at Brutus.</p><p>"So, what do you think?"</p><p>"About the demon?"</p><p>"No, the city."</p><p>"…It's good."</p><p>Brutus spoke quietly after a short pause.</p><p>Although he had a neutral expression on his face, I could tell from the sparkle in his eyes that he found the city to be more enjoyable than he was letting on.</p><p>I couldn't help but grin at that, and my lips were just about to move when Suriol made his way back into view.</p><p>"I'm back."</p><p>"This?"</p><p>When I turned my head, I was shocked to see him holding a demon in his hands. Suriol brought him forward.</p><p>"I caught him snooping a while back and was wondering about what we should do with him? As I did not know what to do with him in your absence, I kept him alive, but now that you are present, I await your instructions."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-791.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-793.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

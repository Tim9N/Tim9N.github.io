        <p>It all happened so quickly, but when she felt 'his' gaze fall on her for just a split second, time seemed to come to an abrupt halt, and so did her world.</p><p>His expression was the same as usual—a little aged. Perhaps a little different, but it wasn't so different from how it had always been.</p><p>Yet, for some reason, in that moment, it felt as though that simple gaze told her a thousand words.</p><p>He nodded at her and said something.</p><p>She couldn't quite make out what those words were.</p><p>That was because she knew exactly what he was going to do, and in that moment, her mind blanked.</p><p>Her usually brilliant mind blanked, and she dully stood on the ground, staring up toward the sky, which was soon enveloped by a brilliant white light that came directly from her father's body. It enveloped the sky in its entirety.</p><p>BOOOM—!</p><p>That was the last thing she saw before a terrifying explosion covered the sky, and she was hurled a great distance away from the scene.</p><p>BANG—!</p><p>She collided with a tree, and if it weren't for the protective shield that materialized around her just as she was about to make contact with the tree, she likely would have sustained significant injuries.</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>With a groan, she forced herself to look up, and that was when she realized that the mist that had blanketed the sky previously had completely disappeared.</p><p>Her mind, which seemed stained with something moments prior, seemed to clear up.</p><p>But none of that concerned her at the moment. What she was concerned about was something else, and she hastily looked around in the sky for any signs of 'him'.</p><p>But no matter how hard she looked, she couldn't find him. In fact, she couldn't see anything, and her legs started to go numb.</p><p>That was until a hand pressed against her shoulder and a familiar voice reached her ear.</p><p>"…He's gone."</p><p>"W..what?"</p><p>When she turned her head, she caught sight of a hazy, almost transparent figure.</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>She thought he sounded familiar, but the way he looked… was that really who she thought he was?</p><p>"It's me."</p><p>His voice was hoarse, almost feeble, but when he turned his head and their eyes met, Melissa understood that it was really him.</p><p>"What are you doing here? How did you get here? Were you here originally?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>He shook his head and stared into the distance. Toward a spot where she couldn't see.</p><p>"Are you really fine?"</p><p>"…"</p><p>Melissa didn't answer. It was a question she didn't know the answer to. Was she fine? She didn't feel very much. And that was a problem.</p><p>She just felt… empty.</p><p>And she didn't know why.</p><p>She just did, and found everything hard to process.</p><p>"I… I don't know."</p><p>She was eventually able to mutter those words. Taking out her glasses, her vision started to blur, and she found herself unable to see what was ahead anymore.</p><p>In all honesty, she could've had her eyesight fixed a long time ago.</p><p>Be it a potion or surgery, she could've. She was rich and was smart enough to produce a potion that could fix her eyesight.</p><p>She just didn't want to.</p><p>There were times when her blurred vision would stop her from feeling people's gazes on her and give her peace of mind.</p><p>There was no one around her at the moment apart from Ren, but even so, she didn't want to keep her glasses on.</p><p>She… Didn't want to see what was above her anymore.</p><p>***</p><p>'She's surprisingly calm.'</p><p>The thought crossed my mind when I stared at Melissa beside me. At least, that was what I was able to perceive from her on the outside.</p><p>Whether she was truly calm, I wasn't too sure, but I didn't have time to care.</p><p>My entire body was writhing, and the pain that was permeating every part of me was making it difficult for me to maintain any semblance of sanity.</p><p>'It's good that he made things easier for me.'</p><p>When I looked up and stared at the area above me, I knew that things weren't over yet. Still, the situation was very advantageous for me at the moment.</p><p>Especially since I was in no state to properly fight at the moment.</p><p>There was something that I had to do before coming here, and that took almost everything from me. But it was worth it.</p><p>Swoosh—!</p><p>With the sudden blurring of my vision, I appeared before a certain area in the sky and looked around me. That was until my attention was eventually drawn to a dark spot in the sky. It was writhing in the air, and the skeleton of a figure was gradually beginning to take shape as it did so.</p><p>I didn't waste a second and arrived before it.</p><p>"It looks like I've arrived on time."</p><p>I pressed my hand against the blob, and the moment I made contact with it, I felt a soothing energy spread throughout my entire body from head to toe.</p><p>My body, which was briefly disappearing and then reappearing, started to take shape again, and the excruciating pain that had been pulsating through every part of me started to subside.</p><p>It was a scene that I had experienced a couple of times already, and my comprehension of the laws started to increase at the same time.</p><p>The more I was able to comprehend, the more I found myself able to use Kevin's old powers.</p><p>It was also thanks to that that I was able to get into the Pillar without destroying it from the outside. It still took a little toll on me, but it was a necessary struggle.</p><p>"You… who are you?"</p><p>While I was enjoying the warm sensation, I heard a certain voice, and when I looked down, I saw that the blob had transformed into a demon.</p><p>His expression was anything but friendly, and the power that radiated from his body was also nothing to scoff at. With that being said…</p><p>"Should you really be talking to me when you're in that state?"</p><p>I placed the palm of my hand against the demon's shoulder, and immediately he froze in place. Golden runes whirled all around the area where the Prince and I were standing and wrapped themselves tightly around his body.</p><p>My breath left my body, and I found myself struggling to keep my composure. In spite of this, I cast my gaze off into the horizon and nodded my head.</p><p>WOOOOOOOM—! A blue light headed our way and enveloped the entirety of my vision. A powerful force soon enveloped the area that the demon and I were in, and everything turned silent.</p><p>I wasn't sure for how long things were like that, but when my sight returned, I found myself standing in the middle of the air with two black orbs levitating in front of me.</p><p>It took a while for it to sink in, but pain unlike anything I'd ever felt before started to cover every inch of my body.</p><p>"Haaaa…. haaa…."</p><p>I struggled to keep my breath in check and had to take several large gulps of air in the process. It was for a short moment, but the pain that came upon the complete destruction of my body almost made me faint from the pain.</p><p>Ever since the war had started, the only thing I felt was pain, and I was starting to wonder, just when exactly was I going to get used to this pain?</p><p>I wanted to get used to this pain.</p><p>"Are yer alright?"</p><p>It was Gervis's voice that broke me out of my thoughts, and when I turned to look at him, I shook my head.</p><p>"No."</p><p>The pain I was experiencing wasn't something I could describe with words. I was anything but okay.</p><p>Still.</p><p>I was still hanging there.</p><p>"Is… is it over?"</p><p>Gervis asked, looking at the two orbs in the sky. I shook my head again and extended my hand to where the orbs were floating.</p><p>"It's not over until the core over here is destroyed."</p><p>I was able to feel the demonic energy that was pulsating from the core as soon as I got a hold of it and held it in my grasp. The other orb, on the other hand, softly moved toward my mouth, and I quietly ingested its content.</p><p>Once more, I was engulfed in a whole world of pain, but I bore with it.</p><p>It was a lot lighter than the other pain I felt.</p><p>Crash—!</p><p> Only once I finally managed to ingest all of the contents within the orb did I finally clench my hand and smash the core in my hand. </p><p>Rumble—! Rumble—!</p><p>The entire Pillar began to shake almost instantly after that, and the world contained within it showed signs of collapse.</p><p>I turned to look at Gervis for a brief moment before looking down at Melissa below.</p><p>"Do me a favor and bring her out with you la—"</p><p>I had to stop myself mid-sentence. All of a sudden, a projection appeared right before my very eyes, and all it took was one glance to understand what had happened.</p><p>My heart sank.</p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p>"Wait, wha—"</p><p>Those were the only two words I was able to utter before waving my hand and disappearing from the spot.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-833.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-835.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

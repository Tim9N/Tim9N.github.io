        <p>For a brief moment, I shut my eyes in an effort to permanently etch the scene in front of me into my memory.</p><p>I had to.</p><p>Never again did I expect to see this sight again.</p><p>An arrogant voice once again echoed out loud.</p><p>"Did you not hear me? Who are you? What are you doing here? What's your relationship with Melissa?"</p><p>My lips trembled.</p><p>I was struggling. I really was.</p><p>I found myself fighting an uphill battle to maintain my composure as I looked at the man in front of me. His glare was strong, and the arrogance in his demeanor was clear.</p><p>'It has been so long...'</p><p>…I was almost starting to get emotional.</p><p>"Are you deaf? Did you not hear me?"</p><p>He had a firm grip on the collar of my shirt. As he tightened his hold on me, his emerald eyes cast a menacing glare in my general direction.</p><p>I felt my body get lifted off the ground, but I did nothing.</p><p>"Tell me! What's your relationship with Melissa!?"</p><p>Once more, my lips were quivering, and I raised my head in an attempt to conceal the expression on my face.</p><p>'This is too much…'</p><p>I was almost starting to feel thankful for Kevin.</p><p>"Answer me!"</p><p>He raised his fist and tried to punch me.</p><p>I finally came to and cocked my head to the side just in time to avoid getting punched in the face by his fist.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>The fact that I was able to avoid being hit by his fist appeared to startle him, as his face went blank for a brief moment. The sight made me grin, and I pressed my hands against his forearms.</p><p>I only applied a little pressure.</p><p>"Aghh."</p><p>Instantaneously, a distorted expression appeared on his face, and I gently yanked his arms away from my collar. It was honestly effortless.</p><p>"Le-let go!"</p><p>He glared at me with a distorted look.</p><p>"Do you know who I am?"</p><p>"Yes, I do."</p><p>I nodded my head. Of course, I knew who he was.</p><p>"Then I suggest you let go and scram away from Melissa!"</p><p>"That's not possible."</p><p>I shook my head with a serious expression. His face distorted further, but I didn't mind as I simply enjoyed his reaction.</p><p>It had been so long since I had seen this version of Jin, and I just couldn't help myself.</p><p>Leaning closer, I softly whispered into his ear.</p><p>"You see, the two of us have a special relationship."</p><p>Special in the fact that we were business partners, but obviously, I omitted that part.</p><p>…and I was glad I did, as Jin's face bleached completely as horror flashed across his face.</p><p>"What did you say!?"</p><p>My lips trembled once again.</p><p>I had to take a deep breath in order to keep my composure.</p><p>"You've heard me correctly the first time."</p><p>After tapping on his chest, his entire body froze while I composed myself and adjusted my clothing. I reached out and patted Jin on the shoulder as I turned my head to look in the direction of Melissa, who was completely oblivious to what was taking place.</p><p>"I suggest you give up. It's for your own good."</p><p>She's a lost cause.</p><p>Aside from her work, I never saw her show any interest in anything romance related. The Jin in my world understood this long ago and seemed to have given up on her.</p><p>…I didn't want this version of Jin to suffer for his whole life.</p><p>"I'll kill you-huh? Hu!? W,what are you doing!?"</p><p>Thinking about how pitiful his life would be, I unknowingly found myself hugging him. I was just as startled as Jin was by my actions, but once again, thinking about his love life, I found myself hugging him even tighter.</p><p>"Let go of me! What are you doing!? I,I like Melissa. My heart is already tak-"</p><p>"Let me stop you right there."</p><p>I let go of Jin and stepped back.</p><p>Patting him on the shoulder, I seriously looked at him.</p><p>"For your information, I have a girlfriend. I was just hugging you out of pity. I have no interest in you."</p><p>***</p><p>A number of people emerged from the shadows of an impressive building to extend their greetings to a number of people coming in their direction. Both sides exuded an imposing aura that did not lose out to the other.</p><p> "Hoho, who would've thought someone as esteemed as you would contact me first."</p><p>Jerome boisterously laughed as he went to greet Edward Stern. The Guild master of the Angel Wing Guild.</p><p>He extended his hand.</p><p>"Do you know just how surprised I was by your text message? The Guild Leader of the largest Guild on earth suddenly said that he wanted to work with me… Ah, what an honor."</p><p>Hearing his words, which were obviously tinged with sarcasm, Edward's face underwent no change as he extended his hand forth and shook it.</p><p>"It is indeed your honor."</p><p>Jerome's face stiffened, but he soon smiled again.</p><p>"Not very humble, are we?"</p><p>"Why would I be?"</p><p>Edward looked at him with squinted eyes, a formless pressure coming out of his body.</p><p>"Am I supposed to pretend to be humble? I'm merely stating the facts. It is indeed your honor to meet me."</p><p>In spite of Jerome's best efforts to conceal it, the rage that was building up on his face was obvious even as he tightened his grip.</p><p>"Indeed, you are the Guild Master of the number one Guild. What's the point of being humble when you're merely stating the truth?"</p><p>"I'm glad you noted this."</p><p>Edward finally let go of his hand and Jerome did the same.</p><p>The two sides separated, and Edward looked around.</p><p>"Should we get down to business?"</p><p>"Please."</p><p>Jerome extended his hand and invited Edward and his entourage into the building.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Just then, his eyes caught sight of a certain figure, and his smile widened.</p><p>"Could this be your daughter?"</p><p>He deeply gazed at the young girl who stood behind Edward. She was a beauty without a doubt. Jerome was not sure that he had ever seen a woman who was as beautiful as she was in his life, and he believed that his wife was the most attractive person in the world.</p><p>Furthermore, judging from her aura, she was without a doubt extremely talented.</p><p>The more he looked at her, the more he liked her.</p><p>"This is indeed my daughter."</p><p>Edward stepped forward, blocking Jerome's sight.</p><p>As he looked down on him, the intangible pressure that had been emanating from his body just a few moments earlier grew to an even greater intensity.</p><p>"Is there a problem?"</p><p>"No, no."</p><p>Jerome shook his hands.</p><p>"I was just very surprised to see how talented your daughter is. Not only is she beautiful, but she's also very talented. I'm a very envious man."</p><p>He turned around and stared at a young man who seemed utterly enthralled by the young girl's appearance.</p><p>He had long green hair and thick brows, both of which contributed to his overall attractive appearance. He had a body that was rather well built, and the most notable feature about him was the color of his eyes; they were emerald, and they seemed to sparkle alongside his hair.</p><p>"Kyle."</p><p>"Huh? Father?"</p><p>It was only after Jerome called out for him that he snapped out of it.</p><p>Jerome beckoned him with his hand.</p><p>"Come here, I'd like to introduce you to someone."</p><p>Looking at where his father was, Kyle immediately became excited and rushed forward.</p><p>After stopping next to his father, he continued to stare fixedly at the young woman who was standing behind Edward. It was a shame that she didn't pay any attention to him at all.</p><p>Jerome started to introduce him.</p><p>"This over here is my son. Kyle. He's just recently turned twenty five and is about to break through to &lt;C&gt; rank."</p><p>He drew out the last few words on purpose as his face flashed with pride.</p><p>It had to be known that reaching &lt;C&gt; rank at such an age was almost unheard of. Typically, one would be in their mid thirties before ever achieving such a rank... If they were even capable of achieving it.</p><p>It went without saying that his talent was unparalleled.</p><p>Even Edward was unable to conceal his surprise as he was forced to cast a few glances in his direction multiple times. Jerome's eyes were clearly drawn to this particular detail as he guffawed broadly.</p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p>"Pretty good."</p><p>Edward honestly said, taking his eyes away from the youth.</p><p>"It's good to know your son is this talented. I'm sure he'll make a good addition to your guild in the future. With that being said, let's get down to business. I don't have much time to spare."</p><p>He departed shortly after that, no longer paying any attention to the youth.</p><p>His daughter trailed closely behind him while maintaining her expressionless face. She didn't even give his son a sideways glance. A stark contrast to him, who couldn't stop gawking at her.</p><p>"Y,you're right."</p><p>Seeing Edward leave, Jerome's fist silently clenched, but he was able to force a smile.</p><p>"Let's get going then."</p><p>He proceeded to lead them into the building.</p><p>Coldness flashed across his eyes as he led them into the building.</p><p>'Let's see how long you can be arrogant for.'</p><p>***</p><p>"How did it go?"</p><p>"I managed to find the clue."</p><p>As I was leaving the building, I saw Matthew walking in the opposite direction. When I thought about what I had been able to piece together from Melissa's recollections, I realized that my mind wasn't exactly in the right place.</p><p>…I hoped that I was wrong.</p><p>I really did.</p><p>"Judging from your expression, it looks like you really do have an idea."</p><p>Matthew happily smiled while leaning against the side of the building. Lifting his head to stare at the sky, his gaze soon shifted toward my direction.</p><p>"Since you've found the clue, then I guess my job for now is done."</p><p>"You're leaving?"</p><p>Already? Was this all that he wanted to show me?</p><p>Matthew moved away from the wall.</p><p>"My job is done. I've done what I needed to do. Everything else is up to you. We'll meet once more later, so don't miss me too much."</p><p>My brows furrowed, but they soon relaxed.</p><p>When I considered the tidbits of information that I had been able to assemble, it really did seem like I didn't need his help anymore.</p><p>I now had a distinct clue as to what path I needed to take in order to get out of here.</p><p>"Alright, then."</p><p>I exhaled while looking up at the sky.</p><p>"Thank y-"</p><p>I wasn't even able to thank him when I realized that he was already gone.</p><p>After taking a quick glance in all directions and confirming that I was, in fact, alone, I gave a sarcastic grin and shook my head.</p><p>"How rude."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-733.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-735.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

        <p>Clank—!</p><p>A clangorous metallic noise rang out as a large door closed shut behind, and darkness enveloped my vision.</p><p>Step. Step. Step.</p><p>Following this, a series of footsteps echoed throughout the dark place.</p><p>"Hey Smallsnake, does this place bring back memories?"</p><p>"It does."</p><p>"Good times, eh? Back then you were still a nobody and look at you now. Still a nobody"</p><p>"Do you seriously have to say it that way?"</p><p>Despite it being dark. I could vividly feel the annoyance in Smallsnake's voice.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>Pausing, I repeated.</p><p>"I really do."</p><p>That said.</p><p>Smallsnake's wasn't anyone particularly big back in my memories. He was the type of guy that helped from the shadows, so nothing much changed.</p><p>*Puff*</p><p>Right then, I suddenly heard a familiar puffing sound coming from next to me. Without needing to look, I already knew who the person was. Who else but Leopold?</p><p>*Puff*</p><p>"Been a while since I've been here."</p><p>"Do you have to smoke ever—hm?"</p><p>I suddenly paused. To make sure I didn't hear incorrectly, I turned my head and looked at a dimly lit orange circle that levitated in the air.</p><p>"You've been here before?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>*Puff*</p><p>With another puff, the orange circle brightened for a brief instant and I was able to catch a glimpse of Leopold nodding his head.</p><p>"I've actually come here quite often in the past. In fact, I know someone that works here."</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Didn't think Leopold would have connections here. This was a pleasant surprise.</p><p>It was then that a deep voice suddenly echoed throughout the dark corridor.</p><p>"We're here."</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>Following this, our vision started to brighten up as another metallic door started to open, revealing a familiar scenery.</p><p>"Wow."</p><p>"Oh, waah."</p><p>"So this is the black market..."</p><p>Surprised sounds echoed from beside me as Ryan, Ava, and Hein stepped forward to get a better look at the place.</p><p>They were all wearing white masks and a black hood to hide their appearances, but I could still tell how excited they were.</p><p>I smiled when I saw just how excited they were.</p><p>But.</p><p>"Calm down for a bit. We're not here to mess around."</p><p>This was the sad reality of the matter.</p><p>The black market was filled with all sorts of interesting stuff and devices, but there was a time and place for everything.</p><p>And now was now the time.</p><p>"You guys can mess around after you are done with all the matters I've assigned to you. For now, follow me from behind."</p><p>Without waiting for them to reply, I proceeded to head deeper into the black market.</p><p>Along the way, I would spot a couple of very interesting artifacts and objects, but through the sheer power of my will, I was able to stop myself from looking at the items.</p><p>"We have a special artifact that no other stall sells!"</p><p>"Buy one get one free!"</p><p>"We have the cheapest prices!"</p><p>The loud voices of the stall owners rang throughout the air as a bustling atmosphere enshrouded the place.</p><p>"Wait up!"</p><p>Snapping me out of my daze, was a low shout.</p><p>Catching up from behind me, I heard Smallsnake's labored voice coming to me.</p><p>"Ren..haa...haaa..slow down a little. You're going too fast."</p><p>"...Alright."</p><p>I finally paused and looked behind me.</p><p>With both hands on his knees, Smallsnake caught his breath and looked up at me.</p><p>"Haaa..haa...Where are we going?"</p><p>Raising my head to stare at the others in the distance, I looked back at Smallsnake.</p><p>"We're going to dungeon seekers to meet an acquaintance."</p><p>"What do you mea—"</p><p>"You'll know when we'll get there."</p><p>Seeing that the others had caught up, I continued walking.</p><p>Compared to the first time I came here, the place looked about the same. However, the atmosphere around me felt different.</p><p>I couldn't quite explain it, but in the past, the black market felt a lot scarier than it was now.</p><p>Was it perhaps because I was stronger? This was most likely the answer.</p><p>"We're here."</p><p>Stopping in front of another large door, two tall guards stood in my way. They both emitted a powerful and overbearing pressure.</p><p>"Halt! This area is restricted for VIPs only."</p><p>Smiling beneath my mask, I handed the guards a card.</p><p>"Here you go."</p><p>As long as the card did not expire in the time I missed, it should still work. Hopefully.</p><p>Thankfully, my worries were unfounded. Scanning the card, the guard handed it back to me.</p><p>"I apologize for holding you back. You may enter."</p><p>He took a step to the side and opened the door for us.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Without waiting any further I entered the door. Following me from behind were the others who looked around curiously.</p><p>The only one that seemed to be unfazed by the whole ordeal was Leopold, who nonchalantly smoked his cigarette.</p><p>Walking past the door, I was greeted by bright lights coming from the ceiling of the room. A red carpet blanketed the floor, whilst a young lady wearing a black suit greeted us by the side.</p><p>"Welcome, to Dungeon Seekers. Do you have an app—"</p><p>"You're here."</p><p>A rough voice cut the lady off.</p><p>Appearing in the distance was a male with blonde hair and a lazy look on his face. Just like in the past, his clothes were a mess and though not clear as he was still far, I could smell a faint scent of alcohol coming off of him.</p><p>"Thomas."</p><p>I greeted.</p><p>Thomas greeted with a teasing smile.</p><p>"Oh? So you remember me?"</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"...and here I thought you completely forgot about me."</p><p>"I would never."</p><p>My head turned sideways when I said those words. If I had to be honest, I did in fact forget about him. Not that I did it on purpose, but stuff happened.</p><p>"I am sorry."</p><p>Thomas clicked his tongue and waved his hand.</p><p>"Whatever, whatever, so, what are you here for?"</p><p>"Actually, we're here to use the dungeons."</p><p>"Dungeons?"</p><p>Thomas paused for a moment. He then smacked his forehead.</p><p>"Right, right, what else would you be here for?"</p><p>Tilting his body, Thomas proceeded to look behind me.</p><p>"Who did you bring with y—huh?"</p><p>Halfway through his sentence, his smile suddenly froze. Noticing this, my brows started to crease. What happened?</p><p>"What are you doing here, Leopold?"</p><p>*Puff*</p><p>"Thomas?"</p><p>A look of pleasant surprise flashed across Leopold's face as his eyes met with Thomas's. Putting the cigarette in his mouth away, he smiled broadly.</p><p>"You've gotten promoted Thomas, congratulations!"</p><p>"Haha, what about you? Last time I checked you were working at a crappy mercenary group. What brings you here?"</p><p>What's going on?</p><p>I dumbfoundedly looked at Thomas and Leopold.</p><p>"You reek of alcohol. Looks like you still got your drinking problems."</p><p>"Eh, look whose talking. You seem to be an even bigger smoking addict than in the past."</p><p>Drinking problems? Smoking addict? What kind of conversation were they having?</p><p>"You two..."</p><p>Interrupting their talk, I coughed slightly. Instantly drawing their attention toward me.</p><p>"Keum, you two know each other?"</p><p>Staring at each other for a good minute, Leopold nodded.</p><p>"You can say so."</p><p>"Leopold and I graduated from the same academy."</p><p>Leopold hooked his arm around Thomas and stared at me.</p><p>"That aside, how do the two of you know each other?"</p><p>"This.."</p><p>Leopold turned his head sideways. I answered for him.</p><p>"He works for me."</p><p>"Works for you?"</p><p>"Yeah, for about three years now?"</p><p>"Two and a half."</p><p>Leopold corrected as he unhooked Thomas's arm from his shoulder.</p><p>"We've been together for about two and a half years."</p><p>"Yeah, that."</p><p>"Is that so..."</p><p>Crossing his arms together, Thomas glanced in Leopold's way and murmured something.</p><p>"He looks to be in a much better mood than in the past..."</p><p>His voice may have been soft, but I was able to hear it. It looks like he really cared for Leopold in his own way.</p><p>Snapping me out of my thoughts, Thomas suddenly clapped his hands.</p><p>"Alright, that's enough of that. So you're here to enter the dungeons, is that correct?"</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>I nodded my head and glanced toward the others.</p><p>"To be specific, we would like two dungeons."</p><p>"Two?"</p><p>"Yes. One for me and Angelica, and another for Hein, Leopold, and Ava."</p><p>Because of the dungeon limits, we couldn't exactly go into the same dungeon. This was a bit unfortunate, but then again, we weren't here to have fun and train.</p><p>I came here with a goal in mind.</p><p>"Do you already know the two dungeons that you want to go to?"</p><p>"Yes. For me and Angelica, Silent cliff, and for Hein, Ava, and Leopold, Desolate Mountains."</p><p>Thomas's brows creased. Then, he murmured in a barely audible whisper.</p><p>"Interesting choice of dungeons..."</p><p>"You can say that."</p><p>The dungeons I had selected weren't exactly special. They were respectively a &lt;A&gt; ranked dungeon, and a &lt;B&gt; ranked dungeon.</p><p>However, those were not the reason why I chose those dungeons.</p><p>The main reason I chose those dungeons was because of the danger that lay within them. Just like in the past, with Everblood, there were demons lurking inside the dungeons.</p><p>Their goal was simple.</p><p>It was to create dungeon overloads. And with the mana density increasing, I feared that in the near future, they would become a very common occurrence. No, they will become a common occurrence.</p><p>Therefore.</p><p>"There are no problems with the dungeons that we've selected, right?"</p><p>I decided to use this chance to get rid of a couple of future troubles whilst at the same time earning the black market's favor.</p><p>It was a win-win situation.</p><p>"No, there are no problems. I'll go get everything sorted out now."</p><p>Thomas patted Leopold's shoulder and turned back.</p><p>I asked Smallsnake who was standing next to me.</p><p>"You already know what to do, right?"</p><p>"Yes. I'll bring Ryan to my old job for a bit. I have to sort out a couple of things."</p><p>With a serious look, Smallsnake placed his head on top of Ryan and ruffled his hair.</p><p>"He should help me get my stuff done faster."</p><p>"Hey, stop it!"</p><p>Despite Ryan's complaints, Smallsnake continued.</p><p>Having stayed with each other for so long, it was only natural that their relationship had developed so much. Compared to the past, Smallsnake also seemed to be a bit more confident.</p><p>Not too much, though.</p><p>I couldn't allow that to happen.</p><p> A proud Smallsnake was not a Smallsnake I wanted to have. </p><p>Pui!</p><p>Just the thought made me want to spit.</p><p>"I've sorted everything, you can go now."</p><p>It was then that Thomas's voice rang from the distance.</p><p>"That was fast."</p><p>Taking one last look at Smallsnake and Ryan, I urged the others to follow from behind me.</p><p>"Alright, let's go."</p><p>*</p><p>WHIIIIIZ</p><p>"Ugh!"</p><p>Coming out of the portal behind me, I stumbled a couple of steps. I eventually stopped in front of an old tree and supported my body.</p><p>"Fucking portals..."</p><p>No matter how many times I tried to get used to the after-effects of portals. I just couldn't.</p><p>"Get over yourself."</p><p>An impassive voice rang a few meters away from me. It belonged to Angelica.</p><p>"You wouldn't get it."</p><p>Shaking my head, I let go of the three and raised my head to get a better look at the place.</p><p>"Just like the name suggested, we're near a cliff."</p><p>It wasn't quite apparent at first, however, once I raised my head and got a better look at my surroundings, I found out that we were currently at the bottom of an extremely steep and vertical cliff that stretched all the way to the ashen-colored sky.</p><p>If I had to make an estimate, it would be that the cliff was around 100 meters tall.</p><p>Around us were a multitude of dead trees. Furthermore, I could also hear the sound of raging water coming from nearby.</p><p>We were likely close to a river.</p><p>"Huuuu."</p><p>Inhaling the air, I smelt a putrescine smell like that of rotting flesh. It was anything but pleasant.</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>Covering my nose with my fingers, I looked at Angelica. Her face was impassive as always, but if one played close attention to her nose, they would notice a slight twitch from time to time.</p><p>Turning around, I secretly smiled.</p><p>'Look at her pretending to not mind the smell.'</p><p>I shook my head. Some people were just too prideful for their own good.</p><p>"Let's get going. The faster we get this done, the faster we get to go back"</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-491.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-493.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

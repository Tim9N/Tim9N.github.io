Crack.</p><p>Gazing at the expanding cracks above me, I remained motionless.</p><p>I could feel my strength sap away from my body, and all my heightened senses returned to what they were before.</p><p>Not quite.</p><p>My strength was indeed shrinking, but it soon stopped at &lt;A&gt; rank.</p><p>"I've broken through..."</p><p>I muttered in a low tone.</p><p>Normally I would've been happy with this development, but at the moment, that was the furthest thing I was feeling.</p><p>All sorts of different thoughts emerged inside of my mind as I looked back at the fight I had not too long ago.</p><p>"Old friend, he said..."</p><p>I already understood this the first time, but...</p><p>The Demon King could also remember the things that had happened in the past.

The voice was very similar to mine.</p><p>Without turning back, I answered.</p><p>"I don't know."</p><p>With everything that had happened in the last couple of hours, my mind was in a bit of a mess.</p><p>Especially after learning the reality of the situation.</p><p>Lowering my head to stare at my hands, I opened my mouth.</p><p>"This strength..."</p><p>"It's not permanent."</p><p>The voice cut me off.</p><p>Clank. Clank. Clank.</p><p>Following the sound of footsteps was a rattling sound.</p><p>Coming to a stop beside me, a figure with white hair raised his head and stared at the expanding cracks in the distance.</p><p>He had a lost look in his eyes.</p><p>"That strength you just witnessed is only a fragment of my old strength, and it's not something that you should use carelessly. With your current body, I would say that you would only be able to use it for at most five seconds."</p><p>"Five seconds?"</p><p>But didn't I just use it for a lot longer than that?</p><p>"It's because I lent you a helping hand. But it was only a one-time thing."</p><p>"Mhh.."</p><p>My forehead creased. I didn't really understand what he was trying to say.

Cool down; three months.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>It was then that I finally noticed it.</p><p>A new skill.</p><p>"Why is there no name?"</p><p>I questioningly looked at the other me. Apart from a few sentences below, all I could see were question marks.</p><p>What was this?</p><p>"Is this—"</p><p>"It's as you think. It's what you've just used."</p><p>My brows furrowed.</p><p>Was kind of getting pissed by all of the interruptions, but I decided to let it go after I realized that I often did the same thing.</p><p>"I see."</p><p>I then calmly nodded my head.</p><p>It didn't take me long to accept the reality of the situation. Staring at my status window, I caressed my chin and pointed at a certain area.</p><p>"Why is the cooldown so long?"</p><p>Never before had I ever had a skill that had a cooldown. Let alone, one this long. Was it because I was still too weak to use it?</p><p>"It's exactly what you're thinking. You're still too weak. At least not now. Your mind and body can't control that strength. You will only die if you use that power carelessly."</p><p>"...Right."</p><p>This sort of made sense.</p><p>During that brief moment when my power was activated, I could feel that it was something that belonged to me yet at the same time didn't.</p><p>It would probably take me years to master that power.</p><p>"The stronger I become, the less the cooldown and more time I can use the skill, right?"</p><p>"That's right."</p><p>Crack. Crack.</p><p>The cracks in the sky started to expand even more rapidly.</p><p>[Ren.]</p><p>Just then, a voice entered my head. It was Angelica.</p><p>[Ren, can you hear me.]</p><p>She sounded rather panicked.</p><p>The edges of my lips curled upwards.</p><p>'I'm alright.'</p><p>So she wasn't as apathetic as she looked outwardly. Or was she just afraid that I would die eventually leading to her death...</p><p>Tsk.</p><p>[The dungeon is about to break, are you not going to leave?]</p><p>"Leave, huh?"</p><p>Fixing my eyes at the expanding cracks in the distance, I closed my eyes.</p><p>Feeling the cool breeze, I eventually shook my head.</p><p>'I won't be leaving.'</p><p>[What!?]</p><p>Angelica's voice raised a few pitches. I felt this even more as it was right inside of my head.</p><p>[You're not leaving? Do you have any idea what you're doing? If you stay here, you will be going to the Demon World! The Demon World!]</p><p>'I know...'</p><p>[If you know, why are you even doing this? It's suic...]</p><p>Angelica stopped herself mid-sentence. Clearly, she must've remembered the strength that I had previously displayed.</p><p>Well, I no longer had that strength anymore.</p><p>But she didn't need to know this.</p><p>'Do me a favor, Angelica. Tell my parents and the others that I will be going for a while. Not much, about half a year or a bit more, not really too sure, but I won't be gone for too long.'</p><p>[Half a year?]</p><p>'Yeah...'</p><p>[But how can you come back?]</p><p>I smiled and turned my head toward my right.</p><p>'Don't worry about it. I've got my means.'</p><p>I wasn't expecting this trip to be a long one.</p><p>Only about half a year if things went according to plan. But there were things I needed to get done now.</p><p>Leaving sucked, but this was probably for the best.</p><p>I needed some time to myself. Time to sort out my thoughts.</p><p>[I see...]</p><p>Fortunately, it didn't seem like Angelica was the type of person to insist. After I expressed my feelings about staying back in the dungeon, she didn't continue asking and just accepted the situation.</p><p>[You said half a year, correct?]</p><p>'That's right.'</p><p>If possible, I wanted to stay less, but who knows...</p><p>[...Okay. I will tell them this.]</p><p>'Thanks.'</p><p>[Hmph.]</p><p>Angelica snorted.</p><p>I could already paint a picture of her crossing her arms together and turning her head away to express her displeasure.</p><p>I almost laughed.</p><p>[I'll be leaving now. If you come a bit later, don't blame me for what your family does to you.]</p><p>'Alright, alright.'</p><p>Following her words, the connection between us cut, and the smile on my face faded.</p><p>After a while, I eventually murmured.</p><p>"A pity we're still not contracted."</p><p>Had we been contracted, I would've been able to talk to her even if I was in the human domain. Perhaps I could've even talked to my parents.</p><p>Almost felt tempted to stop her and sign a contract.</p><p>"You made the right decision."</p><p>Just then, Ren spoke. His next words shocked me quite a bit.</p><p>"I will use this half a year to train you."</p><p>"Train?"</p><p>Staring at him, our eyes met, and he calmly nodded his head.</p><p>"You must've felt it, haven't you? ...The difference between you and Jezebeth."</p><p>Opening my mouth, I eventually closed it.</p><p>I then lowered my head and secretly clenched my fist.</p><p>"Yes..."</p><p>Despite having his strength considerably reduced due to the fact that he had only sent his clone, I could still feel how big the gap between the two of us was.</p><p>Quite frankly, I wasn't sure if I could ever beat him even if I reached a similar level to him in the future.</p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p>Ren spoke. His voice was very calm. It felt as though this was within his estimation.</p><p>"You may not be able to beat him now, but you will definitely be able to beat him in the future. Especially if you have me training you."</p><p>Gazing at his eyes and seeing my reflection in them, I sighed.</p><p>"I understand..."</p><p>Looking up at the sky and massaging the back of my neck, my eyes became sharp.</p><p>"I'll say this right here and right now, but I don't trust you at all. Even if you're going to help me train and become stronger, don't expect me to become your dog."</p><p>If this was his goal in training me, then tough luck.</p><p>There was no way I was going to trust him that easily. This was especially so after I learned of his past, and everything that he had pulled on me in the past.</p><p>He may try to help me out, but that didn't mean that he was on my side.</p><p>I needed to keep this in mind.</p><p>"Heh."</p><p>Ren chuckled.</p><p>"It doesn't matter if you trust me or not. I don't really care. But don't worry. It is within my best interest if you get stronger, so don't think too much."</p><p>Squinting my eyes, I stared at the other me for a good minute.</p><p>I could tell that he was trying to use me for his goal, but so was I. If whatever he was doing was within my best interest, I didn't see the need to refuse.</p><p>Our relationship was one of mutual interest. As long as our actions held the best interest of each other, we were good.</p><p>I eventually nodded my head.</p><p>"...Alright."</p><p> Crash—! </p><p>It was then that a loud shattering sound reverberated throughout the whole dungeon, and everything started to fall apart.</p><p>***</p><p>A/N : Yes, there will be another chapter later.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-500.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-502.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

They stared at him with obvious shock on their faces.</p><p>But that wasn't all.</p><p>While whispering among themselves, they also displayed a clear sense of disappointment.</p><p>"Is the Duke only this strong?"</p><p>"…Is he really weaker than that human?"</p><p>"He is playing around, right?"</p><p>They tried to be faint with their voices, but as the whispers grew, so did the noise, and their voices were heard by the Duke whose face twisted savagely.</p><p>'Shut up! How dare you!'</p><p>He wanted to shout at the top of his lungs toward the crowd. But out of sheer willpower, he managed to stop himself.</p><p>...The situation was still salvageable.</p><p>As he raised his head to stare at his opponent, the Duke stared deeply into his eyes.</p><p>'Huh?'</p><p>But the moment their eyes met, the Duke suddenly felt a chill run down his body as he subconsciously took a step back.</p><p>There was no avoiding the audience's observation, who became noisier as the performance progressed.</p><p>"Did you see that? The Duke took a step back.'</p><p>"Is the Duke actually scared?"</p><p>"…This is pathetic."</p><p>The Duke heard more and more voices inside of his head with each passing second. All he could hear were voices at this point.</p><p>But despite all of the voices against him, Duke Azenoch's focus was somewhere else.</p><p>Staring at his trembling arms, he stuttered.</p><p>'A…am I scared?'</p><p>That sensation he felt when he looked at him in the eyes...</p><p>Was it really a fluke? ..Or was he just imagining things?</p><p>When he glanced once again at White Reaper, the sensation he felt before vanished the moment his eyes met.</p><p>'…A fluke.'</p><p>The Duke thought to himself.</p><p>Yes.</p><p>It had to be a fluke.</p><p>How could someone that wasn't even Duke rank scare him?</p><p>Impossible.</p><p>'It's probably because of all the voices around me.'</p><p>There was simply no other explanation.</p><p> "Huuu…"</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Duke Azenoch calmed himself down. Drowning out the noise coming from the arena, he slowly started to channel his demonic energy.</p><p>'If Count rank doesn't work, I will just take it up a notch.'</p><p>Slowly adjusting his rank in an unnoticeable way, he took a step forward and his vision warped. Reappearing in front of White Reaper, he extended his hand and clawed his head.</p><p>Compared to before, his movements were incomparably faster.</p><p>Within a split second, his hand was already nearing White Reaper's head. It was so close, just a couple of inches away, but…</p><p>The Duke's face sank as White Reaper managed to avoid the attack by moving his head back by a narrow margin. Even so, he did manage to graze him just a little bit as a red line traced alongside his cheek.</p><p>Swoosh-!</p><p>Feeling something hurl at him from below, the Duke twisted his body. He too was able to avoid the attack.</p><p>At the same time he avoided the attack, he raised his head and proceeded to sweep his leg in a whipping motion, hurtling it towards White Reaper's head.</p><p>Bang-!</p><p>His leg was connected.</p><p>To the Duke's disappointment, his leg came into contact with his arm which was raised to block his head.</p><p>The Duke gritted his teeth and tried again.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>However, as he was trying to shift his body, the Duke suddenly found a hand grasping his foot. Without giving him a chance to react, an open palm came toward his head.</p><p>A sense of doom rose within the Duke's mind as he watched the hand reach out for his head.</p><p>Demonic energy erupted from his body as he twisted his body at a strange angle and swung his other foot toward his opponent's head with its back heel.</p><p>As he performed this movement, he made sure to keep his gaze focused on his opponent.</p><p>This led him to notice a slight change in White Reaper's expression, as his lips slowly curled into a grin and his left hand shot toward the side of his head.</p><p>'Fuck!'</p><p>By the time the Duke realized he had been baited into doing such a move, it was already too late.</p><p>Bang-!</p><p>With a loud banging sound, the Duke suddenly felt a hand grasp his other leg. Suddenly, he found himself being thrown up in the air before being thrown down with tremendous force.</p><p>Bang-!</p><p>Crashing into the ground, sand swept into the air as a crater formed beneath him. In addition, the Duke felt a great deal of pain running down his back as he struggled to open his mouth.</p><p>The impact was so powerful that he didn't even have time to groan.</p><p>"Again."</p><p>A voice echoed in his ears. By the time he realized what his words meant, his body had once again been flung toward the air.</p><p>Bang-!</p><p>***</p><p>"It's not him…"</p><p>After staring at the white-haired figure in the middle of the arena for a few moments, Lightning Dragon came to this conclusion.</p><p>'It can't be him.'</p><p>It was hard to describe the scene that he was seeing.</p><p>If he had to use a word, it would have to be a...</p><p>One-sided beat down.</p><p>Bang-! Bang-! Bang-!</p><p>An ear-piercing bang continued to reverberate throughout the arena. It was the sound created by White Reaper repeatedly flinging the Duke's body toward the ground.</p><p>How could Lightning Dragon think otherwise if that was all he heard and saw?</p><p>With each swing of his arms, the Duke's body would come crushing down toward the ground, deepening the already formed crater formed from the first impact.</p><p>The sight.</p><p>It was something that was being deeply engraved in the eyes of all spectators present as an immaculate silence enveloped the arena grounds.</p><p>But that wasn't what concerned Lightning Dragon.</p><p>His concern was that the White Reaper on stage wasn't the one he had fought.</p><p>'His mana control, it's completely different from when we fought. In addition, he moves a lot more efficiently than in the past. Every one of his movements seems to be perfectly calculated, and...hm?'</p><p>His thoughts paused for a second.</p><p>Leaning his body closer, his eyes opened widely as he pressed his hand on the window to get a better look at the fight.</p><p>'Wait…'</p><p>His eyes slowly started to enlarge.</p><p>"That…"</p><p>Opening and closing his mouth, his face paled as he came to a sudden realization.</p><p>'He's standing where he was at the beginning of the fight.'</p><p>No, rather, he was only one step ahead of where he previously stood.</p><p>This…</p><p>Who in the world was this?</p><p>Was he really the White Reaper he had once fought?</p><p>'Impossible.'</p><p>Lightning Dragon shook his head. The undeniable reality in front of him shook him to the core.</p><p>It was at that moment.</p><p>"Enough!"</p><p>He was jolted out of his thoughts by a powerful voice that swept across the entire arena. In response to the voice, a tremendous amount of energy suddenly erupted from the middle of the arena, throwing White Reaper's body back before his figure soon crashed into the other side of the arena.</p><p>Bang-!</p><p>All the spectators clung to their necks in an attempt to breathe under the suffocating pressure.</p><p>Duke Azenoch's body emerged from the deep crater.</p><p>His eyes were a deep shade of red, and his body was all dirtied up and messy.</p><p>Glaring in White Reaper's direction, the aura coming out of his body, slowly kept on increasing.</p><p>It didn't take long for a Duke-ranked pressure to emerge from his body. Some of the demons' bodies burst into pieces after his sudden aura release. It was that oppressive.</p><p>But he didn't seem to care as he slowly moved in the direction of where White Reaper crashed which was at the moment covered by a large cloud of dust.</p><p>With a wave of the Duke's hand, the dust swept and White Reaper's figure reappeared.</p><p>Swooosh-!</p><p>Sitting on the ground with his back up against the arena wall, White Reaper's head was lowered.</p><p>The Duke's body began to tingle with bloodlust as he stared at him.</p><p>He was going in for the kill.</p><p>However, what he didn't notice, along with the rest of the spectators in the arena apart from Lightning Dragon, was the upward pulling of the edges of White Reaper's lips.</p><p>Opening his mouth, he slowly mouthed something.</p><p>'Limit Breaker...'</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-530.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-532.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

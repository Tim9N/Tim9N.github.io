It felt rather good as I leaned back and relaxed.</p><p>Okay…</p><p>I guess I could forgive her.</p><p>Not that I was mad at her, to begin with.</p><p>"How's the migration going?"</p><p>I asked Amanda while closing my eyes.</p><p>Her soothing voice reached my ears as I basked in the relaxing feeling.</p><p>'I needed this.'</p><p>"So far, everything has been going without a hitch. Those who come from the same districts are being moved over one at a time, and according to Ryan's calculations, the process should be finished in about a week's time."</p><p>"A week's time?"</p><p>Hmm, that was faster than I expected. I'd originally thought I'd take a month, but apparently, I had severely underestimated how well organized the Alliance was.</p><p>With their help, everything was sorted out rather quickly.</p><p>"Do you have a list of how many chose to remain on earth?"</p><p>"Mhm."</p><p>Amanda nodded her head and removed her hands from my shoulders. I instantly felt that something was missing, but I kept it all to myself.</p><p>She leaned against the desk.</p><p>"Surprisingly, there aren't a lot of people that are choosing to stay behind. The majority of those who have chosen to remain are elderly people and people who feel a strong connection to the land and the homes they have lived in all their lives."</p><p>"I see."</p><p>This was in line with what I had anticipated, but it was reassuring to learn that the number of people who decided to stay put was relatively low.</p><p>I'd make things a lot simpler and less difficult for myself.</p><p>"What about the situation with the demons? Have you cleaned them all up?"</p><p>"About that…"</p><p>Amanda's expression changed a little.</p><p>She looked rather troubled.</p><p>"What is it? Did something happen? Spit it out?"</p><p>"No, well…"</p><p>Amanda sighed and looked at me.</p><p>"It's Emma. She's taken charge of the operation at your orders, but she seems adamant about talking with you at the moment. She's been calling me nonstop for the past few days, and I'm not really sure what I should do…"</p><p>Listening to her words, I turned my head away from Amanda.</p><p>'Well, shit.'</p><p>I didn't need Amanda to clarify further what Emma wanted to talk to me about. It was probably the whereabouts of her father.</p><p>Waylan…</p><p>I had long seen this coming and had been delaying it for as long as possible.</p><p>I… even after all of this time, struggled to think of ways to explain to her what had happened to her father, and while telling her the truth was something that I needed to do, I found it rather hard to do so.</p><p>How was I going to tell her that her father wasn't the person she thought he was?</p><p>'If only Kevin was still here…'</p><p>"Well? What should I tell her?"</p><p>Amanda's voice brought me back, and I pursed my lips.</p><p>Phone in hand, she looked at me.</p><p>"If you want, I can message her right now. I'm not exactly sure since I'm not with her, but I've been getting reports that she's rather restless these days. I think… you should talk to her."</p><p>"I know…"</p><p>I sighed and leaned back against the chair.</p><p>"For now, tell Emma to focus on her mission. Regarding her father, tell her that he's on a very important mission. A secretive one, and that he won't be able to meet her for a while. I'll fill her in on the details later."</p><p>"…Okay."</p><p>Amanda's thumb quickly moved across the screen of her phone, and she quickly sent the message. She then looked at me while putting the phone away.</p><p>"What really happened to her father?"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>I raised my brow.</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>"Ren…"</p><p>Amanda sighed.</p><p>"…For how long do you think we've known each other for? You may be able to fool others because your poker face makes it difficult to read your expressions, but you can't fool me. I've spent enough time with you to know what you're thinking."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>I scooted my chair back while warily looking at Amanda.</p><p> "You're clearly hiding something about Oliver, and while I won't force you to tell me, I can tell at a glance that he's not on some sort of secret mission." </p><p>The room fell into a state of silence after her words.</p><p>I honestly didn't know what to say at this moment, I was being completely seen through by Amanda.</p><p>'Somehow… I don't feel bitter about it.'</p><p>I'd normally feel uncomfortable if someone read through my intentions, but the same wasn't true for Amanda. I somehow felt a bit better, and my shoulders seemed to relax.</p><p>"I really can't beat you."</p><p>I sighed while shaking my head.</p><p>She truly was…</p><p>"Here."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Amanda presented me with a glass of water, and I took a sip. Feeling the coolness in my mouth, I opened my mouth but then closed it again.</p><p>Turning my head to look at her, I had a sudden thought.</p><p>I smiled.</p><p>"Hey, Amanda."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>She looked at me, her brows slowly coming together. The sight made me smile even more as I suddenly stood up and moved toward her.</p><p>She scooted back into the desk.</p><p>"What are you doing? …We're in your office."</p><p>Her voice grew more timid by the second, and by the time I was a few inches away, it was as quiet as a mosquito buzz.</p><p>"Don't worry."</p><p>I gently caressed her hair and moved my head toward her ear.</p><p>I whispered.</p><p>"…Get your mind out of the gutter."</p><p>A white glow formed on my hand, and I touched her forehead. It was time for her to see everything that I went through in that world.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-797.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-799.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

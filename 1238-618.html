        <p>The world was shrouded in melancholy as ashy gray clouds filled the sky.</p><p>WIIIIIING!</p><p>A dazzling light burst forth in the middle of the vacant space and quickly spread everywhere. The gloomy clouds then parted under a terrible pressure that stretched toward the entire world.</p><p>A human figure with distinct facial characteristics was visible within the illumination. The air vibrated as a result of the pressure the figure was emitting.</p><p>Whoever the figure was, they were an absolute master.</p><p>Soon enough the brightness diminished and the human form within the brilliant light became more and more distinct. A black-clad male with two crimson-colored eyes finally emerged in the air as the light dimmed completely.</p><p>Taking a step back, the crimson-eyed figure looked towards the horizon with an uncharacteristically serious expression.</p><p>Riiip—!</p><p>It was then that a hand suddenly stretched out of thin air, grasping the sky, and tearing it apart as though it was tangible.</p><p>White hair, red-blood eyes, and fair skin...</p><p>Out of the darkness came a figure that appeared human. He appeared to be rather ordinary, but only someone with strength approaching the boundaries of the human limit could realize what a miserable existence he actually led. The power hidden in this weak looking body could wipe out the planet with a single wave of his palm. It was horrible.</p><p>Devastation was what the white-haired figure saw as he floated in the sky and cast a detached gaze downward. A world now on the point of extinction.</p><p>A smile formed on his face.</p><p>Then, lowering his head and staring at the crimson-eyed male below him, the white-haired individual's eyes rippled slightly.</p><p>The crimson-colored eyed male, Kevin, stared back, and silence enveloped the world.</p><p>While neither of the two figures spoke, a great deal of energy erupted from their respective bodies before they silently collided.</p><p>Everything below them crumbled as a powerful wave from their collision fanned out.</p><p>Finally, after an unknown period of time, Kevin opened his mouth.</p><p>"Jezebeth."</p><p>His soft voice traveled through every corner of the world. Yet, deep-seated hatred could be felt in his voice as he spoke.</p><p>Staring at Kevin below, Jezebeth closed his eyes slightly before the smile on his face deepened ever so slightly.</p><p>"How have you been? It's been a while since we've last seen each other."</p><p>"..."</p><p>Kevin didn't say anything in response; instead, the red hue surrounding his body became more intense.</p><p>The sword in his hand glowed in a majestic color and the world around him shook fiercely.</p><p>In spite of that, Jezebeth showed no change in his expression. Rather, he seemed even more relaxed as he watched Kevin glare in his direction.</p><p>"...You should already know by now that your efforts are futile, right?"</p><p>His words echoed throughout the globe.</p><p>Kevin's expression sank.</p><p>"Not only do you not have the strength to beat me, but you very well know what consequences my defeat will lead to, don't you?"</p><p>Jezebeth's body gently floated toward the ground.</p><p>"To the records, I'm cancer. Something that they weren't able to predict or find out until it was too late. By the time they discovered my presence, I was already reaching the peak of this world...."</p><p>His feet landed on the ground.</p><p>With both hands behind his back, Jezebeth leisurely strolled around.</p><p>Kevin could only watch him from the distance without doing anything.</p><p>"You might wonder, how is it possible for the records to have not detected my presence when they are supposed to be so powerful? ...Well, the answer is rather simple. The records aren't exactly a sentient being, rather, they are a primal source code of the universe that has basic cognitive abilities. Almost like an infant. It will only act when it finds its existence is under threat."</p><p>Jezebeth chuckled a little.</p><p>"...and that existence is none other than me."</p><p>A majestic white glow erupted from Jezebeth's body as he extended both of his hands.</p><p>Kevin fiercely stabbed his sword on the ground and held his ground as a gust of powerful wings swept past his body, sending his hair and clothes fluttering away.</p><p>The gale didn't last for long as it soon calmed down.</p><p>"And with regards to their reaction to finding the existence that is threatening them..."</p><p>Jezebeth met Kevin's eyes.</p><p>"That's where you came into play. Desperate to stop me from reaching them, the records created you. Everything that happened to you in the past, was all premeditated by the records."</p><p>"Stop talking."</p><p>Kevin mumbled while he clenched his teeth and glared at Jezebeth.</p><p>But in spite of that, he never once moved to fight Jezebeth. It wasn't that he couldn't, it was that he didn't want to.</p><p>"Want to know a funny coincidence? "</p><p>Jezebeth suddenly asked.</p><p>Kevin didn't respond.</p><p>"...Don't you think we have a lot of things in common? From our red eyes, our past, which is shockingly similar...with both our parents dying from a very young age, both from outsiders, leaving us orphaned...Do you really think it's a coincidence?"</p><p>Kevin didn't answer. He honestly didn't know, nor did he want to hear the answer, but it wasn't as if Jezebeth could read his thoughts. And even if he could, he would've probably still continued speaking.</p><p>His next words thunderously burst inside Kevin's head.</p><p>"Nothing is a coincidence. You were created by the records, and modeled after me. From your past to your unique features...you were modeled by the records to resemble me because you were created for the sole purpose of killing me...but..."</p><p>He tilted his head slightly as he looked at Kevin.</p><p>"...but I swear I could remember you having white hair in the past. What happened to your ha—"</p><p>"It's none of your concern, Jezebeth."</p><p>Kevin cut off in an aggressive manner.</p><p>"Oh?"</p><p>Jezebeth inched closer to Kevin, surprised by his reaction.</p><p>"Is there something you are hiding from me?"</p><p>He asked in a curious manner.</p><p>Kevin instinctively took a step back when he saw Jezebeth nearing him.</p><p>'Ah.'</p><p>His eyes opened wide when he realized what he had done.</p><p>But it was too late. Jezebeth noticed his reaction and smiled deeply.</p><p>"But I can tell..."</p><p>He inched even closer.</p><p>"...I can tell that you can't kill me. I don't know exactly why, but for some reason, I know that you are purposely not killing me despite having the power to do so."</p><p>Jezebeth's head tilted a little.</p><p>"Now...what I really want to know, is...why?"</p><p>"Why are you refusing to kill me?"</p><p>[Synchronisation complete] : +5%</p><p>A low chime rang inside Kevin's head and his eyes opened.</p><p>"Why am I refusing to kill you?"</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Kevin's crimson red eyes flashed with a cold light. Then, focusing his attention on the red book in his hand, he mumbled.</p><p>"...Because your death will destroy the universe."</p><p>***</p><p>Embarrassment.</p><p>That was how one would describe how Azeroth felt in the last couple of decades.</p><p>He felt utter embarrassment.</p><p>Ever since his castle had been infiltrated and he had lost track of the thieves who had stolen his possessions, Azeroth had become the butt of the jokes of the other Marquis ranked demons present in Immorra.</p><p>If that wasn't all.</p><p>During his fight against the orcen chief, he was suddenly ambushed out of nowhere by another orc who appeared to be of similar strength to his.</p><p>Although he had managed to escape back then, he had lost a major part of his territory on that day.</p><p>Defeated, and embarrassed, Azeroth became the laughingstock of the demons.</p><p>'...Bastard. I'll kill you when I find you.'</p><p>Since that day, not a single day has gone by that he hasn't reminded himself that he will exact justice on those who have mistreated him.</p><p>For years he had been biding his time, gathering his forces, and improving himself.</p><p>In those years, he had managed to remove several people who had mocked him in the past, including high ranking demons that were on the same level as him.</p><p>However...</p><p> He was never satisfied with their removal. </p><p>And there was a simple reason for that. The reason was that he knew. He knew who the main culprits were.</p><p>The people who had infiltrated his castle and robbed him of his possessions.</p><p>They were the ones who were responsible for all of his troubles. The orc too...</p><p>...and for over sixty years he had been waiting for those individuals to come back to this planet. There were several items in his possession that were connected to him by blood. If ever, the thieves who infiltrated his castle and robbed him of his possessions showed up in Immorra, he would know in an instant.</p><p>And he finally managed to sense his items again.</p><p>After sixty agonizing years...the thieves were back, and they were in the exact location where the orc was, proving to him that they were working together. Or at least, knew each other.</p><p>"Irgon!"</p><p>Azeroth suddenly shouted at top of his lungs while he walked across a long corridor that was blanketed with a red carpet.</p><p>Immediately after his words came out, a creature appeared out of nowhere.</p><p>"You have called?"</p><p>"I have."</p><p>Azeroth replied in a deadpan tone.</p><p>"Gather all of the forces. We're moving."</p><p>"Gather all of our forces!?"</p><p>Irgno's eyes shot wide open.</p><p>"But—"</p><p>"Shut up and do what I say."</p><p>Azeroth cut the demon with a glare. Clenching his teeth, he spat through his gnashed teeth.</p><p>"Prepare for war."</p><p>It was finally time for him to reveal his fangs after he had hidden for so long. So what if his actions resulted in the demon delegate to get angry at him, in his mind, there was nothing else but revenge.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-617.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-619.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

        <p>A white-haired figure suddenly materialized inside a dark hall where thirty or so figures appeared. </p><p>The surroundings fell silent, and all eyes fell on the white-haired man that materialized out of nowhere.</p><p>The sound of heavy breathing could be heard throughout the surroundings, but the increased breathing wasn't out of tiredness, no, it was out of fear. </p><p>A multitude of different emotions flashed on the faces of the people present. </p><p>Respect, awe, jealousy, fear, and even more fear. </p><p>Step—! Step—! Step—!</p><p>The white-haired man's footsteps echoed throughout the hall; it was the only sound that the people present could hear, perfectly synchronizing with the rhythm of their heartbeats. </p><p>Sitting atop a flight of stairs by the end of the hall was a gigantic and obscure black throne. </p><p>An eerie chill permeated throughout the hall as no one dared to speak a single word; they all looked towards the white-haired figure that was slowly walking towards the throne by the end of the room. </p><p>Each step the white-haired figure took was slow and steady, however, to those present, each step carried an unprecedented amount of pressure as some couldn't help but secretly swallow a mouthful of saliva. </p><p>Finally arriving at the throne, the white-haired figure slowly sat down on it. </p><p>Propping his arm up with the aid of the armrest of the throne, the white-haired figure, better known as the Demon King, rested the side of his cheek on his hand which was curled into a fist. </p><p>Without looking at the people in the room, he slowly closed his eyes. </p><p>***</p><p>The clouds covered the sky like a big black sheet, completely masking the light that was coming from the sun above the sky.</p><p>Nothing could be seen except a darkness that seemed to go on forever. </p><p>BOOOM—! </p><p>The darkness did not last for long, however. Thunderous explosions rang throughout the world as different colored lights began to spread throughout the sky. </p><p>BOOOM—! BOOOM—! </p><p>Smoke permeated throughout the world as the ground shook and black creatures fell from the sky like wingless birds, crashing onto the ground, and forming small craters around the area they fell. </p><p>Bang—! </p><p>Levitating in the sky like creatures of justice, and with light spreading out from behind them, a dozen or so figures stared at the area where the black creatures had fallen. </p><p>Slowly descending down toward the ground, a woman wearing a silver armor that shone brightly and gently wrapped around her figure finally opened her mouth. </p><p>"...Your race does not belong in this universe." </p><p>Her crisp and melodious voice rang throughout the world.</p><p>There was a mixture of displeasure and disgust in her voice as she looked toward a particular creature down below. </p><p>Twitch. Twitch. </p><p>Weakly turning around, the black creature turned his body over and looked toward the woman standing in the sky. With the light shining brightly from behind her, she looked like a goddess that had descended upon the mortal world. </p><p>"Cough...Cough..." </p><p>Coughing black blood down his body, the black creature laughed in deprecation. His blood-red eyes gazed upwards, towards the dark clouds covering the sky. Hanging down his neck was a simple silver necklace; attached to its end was a black box. </p><p>"You...you're...nothing but a bunch of hypocrites..." </p><p>He softly muttered after a while. Right as his words faded, the air froze before the whole world started to tremble. The silver necklace around his body danced up and down his chest. </p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p>The woman in the air spat as anger rose from deep within her voice. Staring at her from below, the black creature coughed. </p><p>"Cough..."</p><p>Supporting his body up with his hand that was constantly trembling, he stared at the sky. </p><p>"Y-ou speak as though we have committed some...cough...grave sin against you all, but what is so grave with us trying to s...survive?" </p><p>"Survive?" </p><p>The woman suddenly scoffed. Raising her hand, a bright yellow sphere resembling the sun morphed on the palm of her hand as bright yellow particles vividly appeared in the air, agglomerating towards the sphere. </p><p>"Does creating havoc on other planets justify your means? What about the billions of creatures you have killed to satiate your thirst? Have you ever cared for them?" </p><p>"Cared? Why should we care?... We are merely following our instincts to conquer and survive. You don't tell an animal how to behave, it is merely written in their biological structure." </p><p>Closing her eyes, the woman nodded her head. </p><p>"It's true that you are merely following your own instincts, and that is why we are following ours as well, eliminating a future threat that can shake the balance of the universe. An unwanted parasite as some might say." </p><p>"Ha...ha...an unwanted parasite..." </p><p>The black creature let out a chuckle before his face slowly became icy. </p><p>"What gives you the right to come here and judge us like you are some sort of god?" </p><p>Mustering every little bit of power inside of his body, the black creature finally stood up and glared at the woman in the sky. </p><p>"I had long seen this coming...I told everyone that you guys were not to be let alone...I told them that you were a bunch of creatures that would come in our path of survival...I told them to get rid of you before it was too late..." </p><p>Pausing, the black creature let out another laugh. </p><p>"Ha...aha...ha...they called me an idiot, a madman, and look what happened. Everyone is dead. Just like I had warned them...cough..."</p><p>Just as he managed to stabilize his footing, with another cough, black blood sprayed on the ground and he fell on one knee. </p><p>"Shit..." </p><p>The moment the creature fell to his knee, the orb that was forming in front of the woman's palm fully formed, and the sky was enveloped by an enormous glow. Lowering her head and staring at the black creature, the woman's words gently words fell down towards the world. </p><p>"Don't blame me for doing this for the sake of our people. Like you've said, we are merely doing this for our own survival." </p><p>"Yo—" </p><p>Before the black creature could say anything else, the bright orb finally descended down towards the ground. In an instant, his figure was enveloped by the orb, and it completely disappeared.</p><p>The only thing that remained intact with the silver necklace that hung from his neck. However, that too disappeared after a while. </p><p>What followed after was a bright light that wrapped around the whole world; similar to when the sun rose from the horizon. </p><p>BOOOOM—! </p><p>A terrifying explosion followed as the earth rose from the ground sending massive chunks of rocks the size of a mountain flying everywhere, completely destroying everything in sight. </p><p>Staring at the scene from above, the woman closed her eyes and turned to face the other creatures levitating in the air that were watching the scene with pure indifference on their faces. </p><p>"That was the last of them, what should we do now?" The woman asked. </p><p>"Let's..khrr...blow up the planet."</p><p>One of the creatures suggested.</p><p>Levitating in the air with an enormous armor warping around his bulky body, a nasal-like sound came out from the creature's mouth with each break he took. </p><p>"Khrr...khrr...ensure that no demon survives. We can't let those parasites continue to exist. Their existence is a threat to the universe." </p><p>Extending his hand, a huge hammer materialized in the creature's hand. Without waiting for the other's confirmation, he raised his hammer in the air.</p><p>Holding onto the hammer above his head for a couple of seconds and seeing that no one was stopping him, the creature let out a deep shout and swung the hammer down. </p><p>"Huaaarg!" </p><p>Dropping down to the ground at incredible speeds, the land cracked apart as the creature's feet landed on the ground. Following this, the hammer came into contact with the ground and the world froze over. </p><p>What followed after was the complete destruction of the planet as the lands, mountains, and everything tore apart. </p><p>***</p><p>Opening his eyes, the demon king's bright red pupils shone brightly as the air inside of the hall chilled considerably. </p><p>Recalling memories of the past, his face cold face twisted slightly, and a horrifying pressure bore down on the hall. </p><p>Gathered around him were the figureheads from the seven clans. A look of horror and respect flashed across their faces as they sensed the terrifying pressure coming from the demon King's body. </p><p>It didn't take too long for the Demon King to recollect himself as he slowly raised his head. </p><p>Glancing around the place, the Demon King's eyes swept over the bodies of each demon present. Every time his eyes paused on a figure, their bodies would unconsciously tremble. </p><p>Once his eyes swept on every figure present, he raised his hand in the air and waved it in the air. </p><p>C...crack. </p><p>The moment his hand fell down, a crack formed in the fabric of space. At the exact moment the crack appeared, the same scene from before he materialized in front of the hall was displayed in front of him, and everyone in the hall.</p><p>The scene where over thirty figures stood in the air, behind a large barrier. </p><p>Gazing at the scene for a brief moment, he finally opened his mouth.</p><p>"...Disappointing." </p><p>The moment he said those words, the hall shook uncontrollably. Before any of the demons present could speak up, he swiped his hand again. </p><p>C...crack. C...crack. C...crack. </p><p>Three more cracks began to form in the fabric of space, as depicted behind them were three different planets. </p><p>Gazing at the planets in front of him, the Demon King's cold voice once again rang throughout the hall once more. </p><p>"Kintuar, Lanet, and Polincet." </p><p>Tapping onto the armrest of the throne, the Demon King swept his gaze over the other demons present. </p><p>"How is the situation with these planets? Have you done as I've tasked?" </p><p>"Yes, your majesty!" </p><p>Stepping up, a lanky demon lowered his body and bowed down on the ground. The demon that was currently lying down on the ground was in fact a Duke-ranked demon and the head of the pride clan.</p><p>Yet, when faced with the Demon King in front of him, there was no semblance of any pride being in his body. In front of such a being, he couldn't dare muster any pride. </p><p>Not daring to look at him, the head of the pride clan started to speak. </p><p>"As you have requested, we have completely saturated the planets with demonic energy. There are no more creatures living inside of those planets apart from our brethren."</p><p>"I see..." </p><p>Nodding his head, the Demon King turned his attention back toward the planets in the distance.</p><p>Opening the palm of his hand and raising his arm toward the space cracks in front of him, the Demon King indifferently asked. </p><p>"The only people inside of the planets are our brethren?" </p><p>"Y..yes." </p><p>"...Okay." </p><p>The Demon King suddenly clenched his hand into a fist. Following this simple gesture, the planets that were being displayed behind the cracks suddenly trembled. </p><p>Then, as though they were in synch with each other, the planets started to rapidly expand as cracks started to form on the outer layers of the planets, revealing the bright red inner layers. </p><p>The expansion happened within an instant. Following the expansions, rocks began to shoot out throughout the space as a bright yellow cloud formed in the middle of the planet. That too was also expanding. </p><p>No sound accompanied the explosion due to the lack of air in space, however, the image of the planets exploding with just a casual gesture of the Demon King's hand became deeply imprinted in the heads of the demons present. </p><p>Opening the palm of his hand once again, the Demon King made a beckoning gesture. </p><p>Following his gesture, three luminous white orbs began to shoot out from the center of the explosion, all headed in the Demon King's direction. </p><p>SHOOOM—! SHOOOM—! SHOOOM—!</p><p>Passing through the space fabric, three white orbs suddenly materialized in front of the Demon King. Passing through the cracks, they all stopped on top of the Demon King's palm. </p><p>Glancing at the three orbs in front of him that resembled small white suns, the Demon King softly muttered. </p><p>"Planetary seeds..."</p><p>Following his words, he brought his palm towards his mouth and sucked the orbs into his mouth. </p><p>The instant the orbs entered his mouth, the Demon King's head recoiled back as a hissing sound rose from his mouth.</p><p>Rumble—! Rumble—! </p><p>The halls of the room shook uncontrollably and all the demons present in the room fell to the ground in a prostrating manner, completely unable to move. </p><p>The pressure did not persist for long as it disappeared as fast as it came. Opening his eyes and staring towards the ceiling of the hall, turbid air began to escape from the Demon King's mouth. </p><p>"Haa..." </p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-465.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-467.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

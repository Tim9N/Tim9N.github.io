        <p>The sky was slowly darkening as the sun proceeded to set. A misty orange layer began to envelop the sky.</p><p>This was typically the time when people would come back home from their jobs.</p><p>Today was different, however.</p><p>[Tri-annual Hero ranking assembly]</p><p>At the moment, everyone was tuned onto one specific event, whether they were watching it on their TVs or another available gadget.</p><p>The Hero ranking assembly.</p><p>The assembly that would determine the ranks of the top heroes of the world.</p><p>At first, it didn't seem all that great, but it was important to highlight that the central government would provide financial support as well as amazing chances for all of the top rankers. Not only that, but the fame attributed to becoming a ranker wasn't something to be taken lightly.</p><p>Large guilds would salivate at the prospect of hiring a ranker, and the resources made available to them would be substantially more than in the past.</p><p>If that wasn't all, those who made it to the top twenty in the rankings would also be given some form of legislative power.</p><p>An illustration of such power would be the ability to cast a vote while determining a crucial matter affecting humanity's future.</p><p>Essentially, the stronger you were, the more power you held.</p><p>"I wonder what rank Ren will get."</p><p>Amanda mumbled as she fixed her gaze on the TV on the wall across from her. The TV was rather enormous, taking almost half of the wall, and the images it showed were clear and of the highest possible quality. It had the effect of making one wonder if they were actually there if one wasn't paying attention.</p><p>Her hand reached to her right as she relaxed on a sofa. Toward a tiny bag of chips.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Amanda felt a tiny hand reach out for her hand as soon as she took a chip.</p><p>"Brother is the best."</p><p>Nola commented while she took the chip from Amanda's hand, leaving her speechless.</p><p>"...He sure is."</p><p>A small and helpless smile spread across her face when she looked at Nola.</p><p>"Your brother will definetly get a high rank."</p><p>"What about first?"</p><p>"That's not possible, Nola."</p><p>Another voice echoed from the other side of the room. The voice belonged to none other than Samantha Dover, Ren and Nola's mom.</p><p>"You're brother has barely turned twenty four. There's no way he can rank first. It would already be a miracle if he ranked anywhere near the hundreds."</p><p>Samantha set a few plates on the modest wooden table in the living room and tilted her head to face Amanda.</p><p>"Actually, what rank is he?"</p><p>"…No idea."</p><p>Amanda shook her head.</p><p>Despite all the time she spent with Ren over the years, his rank was still an enigma to her. She knew it was high, but she didn't know just how high.</p><p>It wasn't something that came up in their conversations.</p><p>"It's starting."</p><p>A soft, deep voice echoed. Ren's father had just walked into the room. The moment that happened, the television screen went black, and Amanda saw her mother's reflection. She was currently seated next to Nola.</p><p>Meeting Amanda's gaze on the screen, she sadly said.</p><p>"I'm sure your dad will be devastated to know that you're more worried about Ren than him."</p><p>Amanda merely shrugged at her mother's words.</p><p>She already had an idea of what rank her father would get so she wasn't particularly interested. At least, not as much as she was interested in knowing what placement Ren would get.</p><p>She figured it would be in the early hundreds and perhaps even in the two digit figures, but knowing Ren, she knew that estimates were worthless.</p><p>He wasn't someone that could be predicted using common sense.</p><p>***</p><p>"The rankings are determined by taking into account a number of elements. Strength, accomplishments, and overall contributions to the growth and advancement of humanity."</p><p>In a spacious auditorium filled with round tables and benches, a firm, solemn voice resounded.</p><p>Rowan Kilimer, a representative of the Central government, took the stage in front of a tiny wooden podium while donning a pair of squared spectacles and a crisp grey suit.</p><p>His hair was well brushed back, and he had a rather solid frame with broad shoulders.</p><p>"The top individuals who are currently existing in the human realm have been ranked after taking the aforementioned aspects into account. This event aims to make the world aware of their accomplishments."</p><p>A large chandelier with brightly glistening lightbulbs in the shape of crystals vividly lit the area.</p><p>There were more than a thousand people seated on the chairs beneath the chandelier. Though it wasn't obvious at a glance, the pressure that came out from each one of the individuals present was terrifying.</p><p>Enough to make any regular person faint at the mere breath.</p><p>Near the back of the room, not too far from them and standing behind a transparent blue barrier, a number of figures silently moved the cameras to focus on the faces of numerous profiles while quietly coordinating with each other to get the best shot.</p><p>"Over a thousand different individuals are gathered today for the new ranking assignments. Some will find themselves dropping out of the rankings, while some others might find themselves entering the rankings for the first time in their lives."</p><p>Rowan raised his head and swept his gaze over the thousand of individuals present.</p><p>"With regard to the benefits of being a ranker, I won't go into great depth. Everyone present should already be familiar with this."</p><p>Rowan laid his arm on the wooden podium and turned to face the opposite direction.</p><p>Then, elevating his spectacles with the index finger of his other hand, he raised his hand and pointed to his right, where a large monitor was situated. It was necessary to mention that there was another monitor of comparable size on the opposite end, to the left.</p><p>"It will take some time until we get to the top twenty, so I'll start disclosing the lower rankings right away. For those that are called up, please remain seated on your chairs. There will not be speeches."</p><p>A picture suddenly showed on the two displays behind him as he pressed the right side of his glasses.</p><p>Depicted on the picture was the image of a burly man with red hair and fiery brows. Next to his name was a shining golden symbol [Top 500], with his name in white not too far from it.</p><p>"Elbert Bray, first time nominee. Congratulations for making it in the ranks."</p><p>The monitors behind switched and started to play short clips of the man known as Elbert Bray. On the monitors, the people attending were able to catch a glimpse of his skills from the short clips that were playing.</p><p>His fighting style was akin to that of orcs, where he would rip through anything in his path.</p><p>While everyone else's focus was on the monitors, the cameras were trained on Elbert Bray, who was seated at the rear of the room with his arms crossed. Although his back was straight and his face was expressionless, it was obvious from the slight curl of his lips that he was trying to hide his joy.</p><p>Nonetheless, no one would point this out. After all, he had just become a ranker. One of the most respected people in the world. Who would dare mess with such a figure?</p><p>'He's pretty good...'</p><p>Kevin quietly commented to himself while he stared at the video on the monitors.</p><p>Carefully analysing Elbert's movements, he was rather impressed.</p><p>'...Well, at least for someone of his level.'</p><p>Kevin took his eyes away from the monitors. Although he was impressed by his skills, that was all there was to it.</p><p>Just impressed.</p><p>Kevin's strength had increased significantly over the previous two years, and he no longer viewed someone in the top 500 as a challenge.</p><p>He wasn't being arrogant, but it was simply how things were. If he had to make an estimate, he was at least within the hundreds.</p><p>'Where is he?'</p><p>Kevin took his eyes away from Elbert and nonchalantly scanned the room with his eyes. They soon paused toward a certain individual sitting near the front.</p><p>'...I wonder why he's decided to come.'</p><p>He was none other than Ren.</p><p>His appearance surprised Kevin quite a bit. Never in his life did he expect Ren to attend a meeting such as this one. His displeasure for such events was quite well known by everyone that knew him. He never really tried to hide it.</p><p>Right as Kevin's eyes paused on his figure, his eyes squinted a little.</p><p>Crossing his arms together, he leaned back on his chair and carefully scrutinized him.</p><p>He looked to be in serious thought as an expressionless look adorned his face. He didn't seem to be amused by what he was seeing.</p><p>Rather, he seemed to be thinking deeply about something else. It was like his mind was not in the event.</p><p>At least, that was what Kevin could deduce from simply glancing at him. He had no idea if it was true or not.</p><p>He had a rather hard time figuring out Ren's thoughts. Especially in light of what happened two years ago.</p><p>He was no longer acting or behaving in the same manner as before. He was in some ways much nicer than before, but at the same time, a lot more reserved. He used to make crude jokes and remarks, but those days were over as he now no longer bothered doing so.</p><p>In a way, his change was sad, but necessary at the same time.</p><p>'...I'm also the same, aren't I?'</p><p>Kevin lowered his head and stared at his two hands which were resting on his knees.</p><p>That vision he saw...</p><p>It drastically changed his worldview. He could no longer see the world as he did in the past.</p><p>Wrinkles slowly started to form on his pants as he clenched them.</p><p>'...It was the only way.'</p><p>"Next up, Morland Jones of Hell's Cat Guild."</p><p>A new name was called out after Elbert's name was mentioned.</p><p>More and more names began to show up on the screen after that.</p><p>"Next up, Jessica Blane of Raging Fist Guild."</p><p>"Next up, Luke Runder of the Union."</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>.</p><p>A growing number of people approached the stage while Kevin was in the middle of his thoughts.</p><p>Rankings from the five hundred's to the two hundred's were beginning to emerge gradually. The majority of those in attendance made an effort to control their reactions, but it was inevitable that some would express their happiness and others their disappointment at their overall results.</p><p>"Next up, Donna Longbern of the Lock Academy."</p><p>Jolting Kevin out of his thoughts he heard a familiar name. Lifting his head, he spotted Donna seated on one of the seats near him.</p><p>She was wearing a stylish black one-piece outfit that suited her hair and accentuated her curves to perfection. Her eyes were complemented by a big purple necklace that dangled from her chest.</p><p>From the last time he saw her, she hadn't aged a single day. Raising his head to stare at the monitors, Kevin focused his attention on her highlights.</p><p>Compared to the ones he had seen three years ago, her highlights weren't much. It was clear that she had been focusing on school duties rather than making any achievements.</p><p>It was also why her ranking didn't increase by much. It was still nonetheless an increase, which was always good.</p><p>[Top 107]</p><p>The golden numbers hang beside her name.</p><p>When the cameras at the back of the room pointed at her, she gave a simple smile, and the people around her clapped.</p><p>Her moment only lasted for about a minute before a new name was called up.</p><p>"Next up..."</p><p>This continued for a little bit more until Kevin finally heard his name.</p><p>"Next up, Kevin Voss of the Union."</p><p>Kevin felt thousands of eyes pause on his body when his name was called out.</p><p>Not minding the eyes of the people present, he calmly smiled. The reactions of the people around him were something he expected.</p><p>He was already ranked in the top hundred while he was just 24 years old. A feat that was on par with Monica's, who at the same age had been classified roughly on the same level as him. No, rather, he had achieved the feat a year earlier than her. With the fact that she was no &lt;SS-&gt; ranked, Kevin's prospects were especially promising.</p><p>Enough to justify the enthralled reactions of those around him. Additionally, no one thought Kevin's position was unusual because his accomplishments were obvious to everyone. Unlike Ren, Kevin wasn't one that kept a low profile.</p><p>[Top 94]</p><p>The golden numbers appeared beside his name.</p><p>Another wave of applause enshrouded the auditorium.</p><p>"Next up..."</p><p>But just like Donna, his moment didn't last for long as a new name was called up, and with each new name that was called up, the louder the clapping became.</p><p>Kevin kept his gaze on Ren throughout the entire time.</p><p>He was genuinely curious about what his rankings would be.</p><p>[Top 60]</p><p>[Top 50]</p><p>[Top 40]</p><p>Time passed and more and more names began to be called up. There were hints of surprise on Kevin's face as he realized that Ren's name had still not been called out yet.</p><p>'...Looks like he's serious about this.'</p><p>His surprise didn't come from Ren's high ranking, but from the fact that he didn't hide his strength like in the past. Normally, he would've probably only shown a skill level that was near to his.</p><p>But for him to go this low...</p><p>There was clearly something he wanted from this.</p><p>[Top 30]</p><p>[Top 20]</p><p>Kevin's expression was very serious by the time the top 20th ranker was revealed.</p><p>He sat up straight on his chair.</p><p>'This might become troublesome.'</p><p>Kevin took a glance at the people in the auditorium. None of the people present currently knew what was about to happen, and Kevin could only imagine the effects that Ren's announcement would have on some of the people present.</p><p>Without a doubt, more than half of the people present would show their discontent.</p><p>Ren's age wasn't really a factor; rather, his lack of notoriety was the main reason. He only had one significant accomplishment—the conference—and that was all. His strength was unknown, his achievements were unknown, and his contributions to humanity were unknown.</p><p>His lack of presence would certainly cause quite a scene, and Kevin could feel it.</p><p>Nonetheless, he leaned back in his chair.</p><p>'I'm sure he must have something planned.'</p><p>In no way would Ren come here without any plans.</p><p>"Next up, Ren Dover of Caïssa mercenary guild."</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Just like Kevin predicted, the auditorium fell into a state of silence.</p><p>Immediately after that, everyone's gaze focused on one particular individual. Black hair, blue eyes....and a calm look on his face.</p><p>He turned his head and smiled as he sensed everyone's attention briefly focusing on him. His smile, well, appeared incredibly false, at least to Kevin.</p><p>As everyone turned to stare at one another with suspicious expressions on their faces, whispers resounded throughout the hall.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>"I think I know him."</p><p>"Wait, isn't he 24 as well? Ranked 18? What's going on?"</p><p>With Ren's information displayed next to him, everyone's eyes grew wide when they learned of his age. The look of suspicion only increased.</p><p>Ren's accomplishments were simply too much for some of the individuals in attendance to comprehend, as their faces changed. If they could hardly accept the idea that Kevin was among the top 100, then Ren's rank was simply not something many of the people present could digest.</p><p>Regardless, no one dared to voice out their objections. They weren't exactly stupid.</p><p>There'd be no way the Central Government and the Union would allow something like this to happen without reason.</p><p>Nepotism? Bribery? Error?</p><p>There were multiple reasons that could've contributed to Ren's rank. But, his capabilities were not one that flashed in the minds of most people present.</p><p>It was just too monstrous of a feat for them to accept.</p><p>"Judging from your looks, it appears as though some of you are unsatisfied with his rank?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Kevin and a large portion of the audience were shocked to hear Rowan's voice echo across the entire auditorium.</p><p>This was the first time that he had not followed the script.</p><p>'What's going on?'</p><p>The sudden turn of events aroused Kevin's interest. His eyes once again paused on Ren. He had a faint inkling that this was orchestrated by him and someone else.</p><p>Rowan looked around the auditorium.</p><p>"Several elements are considered while deciding the rankings, and Mr. Dover over here meets the requirements to get the ranking that he has achieved. We can guarantee you that there has been no foul play when deciding the rankings."</p><p>His voice echoed loudly in a serious and harsh manner.</p><p>In spite of his words, a large majority of the people present still didn't seem convinced. None of them voiced their dissatisfaction, but their expression said everything.</p><p>'We don't trust you.'</p><p>Rowan's eyebrows furrowed when he noticed the atmosphere around the auditorium.</p><p>Just as he was about to say something, Ren, who was leaning his head against his arm, suddenly extended his hand and tapped the air.</p><p>Ding—!</p><p>The auditorium echoed with a crisp sound, reminiscent of two glasses clicking against each other, as ripples spread outwardly from Ren's fingertip. They spread throughout every corner of the auditorium in the time it took for the heart to beat.</p><p>The air began to fracture as an immense pressure began to settle over the entire region, making breathing more difficult. Sword rays progressively emerged from the air fractures in a slow manner, resulting in some of the audience members' faces to flash with horror.</p><p>Within the span of a couple of seconds, the entire hall was filled with sword rays that hovered the heads of everyone in the room like a guillotine waiting to be released.</p><p> Gulp—! </p><p>Gulps were audible throughout, and several of the attendees' cheeks became pale. Their reactions were enough to prove to the people present just how domineering Ren's actions were.</p><p>On another note, Ren didn't specifically target the individuals in the back, the ones recording everything, which was fortunate for them. However, they also had trouble breathing due to the intensely tense mood that pervaded the auditorium.</p><p>"I think that's enough."</p><p>A crisp voice rang in the air.</p><p>An orange veil blanketed the air after the voice echoed and the sword rays that hung in the air disappeared. The overbearing pressure that was pervading the air disappeared, and a short and beautiful figure appeared in the middle of the hall.</p><p>Silently glaring at Ren she placed both hands on her hips.</p><p>"That was a bit much, don't you think?"</p><p>"...I apologize."</p><p>Ren disinterestedly look at the people present before focusing his attention back on the monitors that hung on the walls.</p><p>Monica's eyes focused on Ren for a couple of seconds before she turned around and looked at Rowan who signaled to her that everything was alright.</p><p>Nodding her head, she disappeared from the spot and the air became breathable again.</p><p>It goes without saying that this only pertained to locations farther from Ren. The air was still very tense for those who were close to Ren.</p><p>Only a select few people, Kevin included, were able to maintain their composure.</p><p>At this very moment, Kevin's brows were furrowed tightly. Right now, Monica was on his mind.</p><p>Although she tried to hide it, Kevin caught sight of her palm trembling in the aftermath of the attack.</p><p>The thought made him squint his eyes.</p><p>'Were my eyes playing tricks or...'</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-607.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-609.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

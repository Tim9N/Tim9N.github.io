        <p>[Day 5]</p><p>"Where's everyone?"</p><p>I was taken aback to discover that the lobby of the mercenary headquarters was completely deserted. At any given time, there would typically be at least one or two of the guys lounging about on the sofas.</p><p>"Guess everyone's busy."</p><p>I eventually shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>When I thought about the upcoming event, it made perfect sense. Indeed, I had given a significant amount of work to each of them.</p><p>Without much consideration, I made my way to Ryan's room. Among all the people present, he was most likely the only one who knew where the others were.</p><p>They were probably in the building, but the place was quite big, and since I needed to check up on Ryan, I decided to just ask him since he most probably had eyes on the entire place.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>After making my way to Ryan's room and opening the door, I discovered Ryan hunched over with his back arched and his feet crossed on the chair as he was looking at more than fifty monitors in front of him.</p><p>Displayed on the monitors were the different areas of Ashton city.</p><p>"Oh, you're back."</p><p>Ryan was quickly made aware of my presence, and after giving me a passing glance, he returned his focus to the screens.</p><p>He most likely was aware that I was heading to him long ago and was just being casual about it.</p><p>I approached him and placed my hand on the chair he was sitting on.</p><p>"How's the situation?"</p><p>"They haven't made any movements yet. Not notable ones…at least."</p><p>"This is in Ashton city?"</p><p>"Yes, same for the other cities. Still no major movement."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>I nodded my head, struggling to keep up with Ryan, who looked at all the monitors in front of him without any trouble.</p><p>In fact, every two seconds, the screens would switch and new areas would appear on the monitors.</p><p>While this happened, Ryan would write a couple of notes on a small book that rested next to his keyboard before switching the screens again.</p><p>He kept doing this for all the fifty screens in front of him, and my head started to throb at the sight.</p><p>"I'll leave you to it."</p><p>I gave the back of the chair a light pat before turning around. When I was on the verge of leaving, I suddenly recalled the purpose of my visit here and asked.</p><p>"By the way, do you have any idea where the others are? I didn't see anyone in the lob—"</p><p>"Training room."</p><p>Ryan responded before I could even finish my sentence. I pursed my lips and nodded my head.</p><p>"Alright, good luck with your job."</p><p>It appeared as though Ryan was too preoccupied with what he was doing. It was to the point where he did not care about me at all.</p><p>It didn't really bother me, as I knew his role in the upcoming war was going to be very important.</p><p>I had a lot of things planned out for the upcoming events, and Ryan was going to play a significant part in all of them.</p><p>'Well, everyone will.'</p><p>I had not chosen my members randomly. They were all selected with this event in mind, and it was time for me to finally bear the fruit of their nurturing.</p><p>Bang—!</p><p>As I got closer to the training room, the first thing that I heard was a loud crashing sound, followed by what I took to be Hein's voice.</p><p>"Huak! Take it easy! I'm not made of diamo—huak!</p><p>Bang—!</p><p>'What's going on here?'</p><p>When I first walked into the training room, I didn't know what to make of the events that were taking place there.</p><p>Han Yufei, who was standing opposite Hein and who was all beaten up and full of bruises, continued to punch him relentlessly while he begged for mercy.</p><p> Behind Hein was Leopold, who had a pack of gums in his hand and was cheering for Han Yufei. </p><p>"Go! Go! Beat up him!"</p><p>"You! You're supposed to be on my side—huak!"</p><p>"Oh, right."</p><p>I honestly didn't know how to respond to the sudden situation.</p><p>Letting out a long and extended sigh, my eyes drifted toward a young girl who sat at the back of the room, and I made my way toward her.</p><p>"How long has this been going for?"</p><p>"About the last three hours."</p><p>Ava responded, holding her hand up and staring at the numerous small birds that were resting there.</p><p>Beside her were also multiple cats and mouses, snuggling around her body.</p><p>The sight surprised me, and I pointed at them. She answered before I could even ask.</p><p>"It's a lot easier for me to control animals that have not been too impacted by the mana in the air."</p><p>"I see…and how many can you control?"</p><p>"If you're not talking about beasts affected by mana, which are currently at fifty, then about a thousand."</p><p>She answered, raising her head and looking up at me.</p><p>My eyes jumped up in surprise.</p><p>"A thousand? That many?"</p><p>"Mhm. I could probably push it to a couple hundred more, but that would drain my mana instantly."</p><p>Ava mused to herself, lowering her head and massaging her chin.</p><p>"I've also completed what you've asked me to do and set up multiple stations around the city just like you've asked. I also already coordinated myself with Ryan, so if anything happens, he will be the first to let you know."</p><p>"Perfect."</p><p>I smiled in satisfaction. Ava's progress was a lot faster than I had expected. Everything so far was flowing in accordance with what I had envisioned.</p><p>Ryan acted as the eyes and Ava as the ears.</p><p>With Ryan's access to all of the cameras in the city, as well as Ava's network of animals scattered throughout the city, I had complete control over what was going on in Ashton City.</p><p>Be it those that were on my side, or those that weren't.</p><p>Nothing could escape my sight and ears.</p><p>"Alright, keep up the good work."</p><p>Satisfied with the progress, I stood up and decided to head out of the training room. Just before leaving, I scanned the room and asked.</p><p>"By the way, I don't see Liam anywhere. Do you have any idea where he is?"</p><p>Ava cocked her head to the side to look at me, then tapped on the face of her watch and shut her eyes before responding.</p><p>"He's roaming Ashton city. He's currently in the Northern district, Govian Park. I think he's lost."</p><p>"Okay…"</p><p>'Well, there you go.'</p><p>The effectiveness of the information network that I had established. She was able to provide me with precise information regarding Liam's location in a matter of seconds.</p><p>A satisfied smile spread across my face, and I headed out of the room.</p><p>Even though I could still hear Hein's helpless screams in the background, I didn't pay them any attention. My mind was preoccupied with other thoughts.</p><p>'Now that the information network has been completely set up and I've got eyes on the entirety of Ashton city…It's time that I push up my next plans.'</p><p>I had a grand total of five days left before the human domain would all of a sudden face a catastrophe that had never been seen before.</p><p>During those five days, I intended to finish putting everything in place before handing over responsibility for the rest to Kevin.</p><p>…because from that point on, I will begin the process of developing a new sword art and incorporating the demonic bloodline into my body.</p><p>Only then would I be able to reach a point where I could fight toe to toe against Malik Alshayatin.</p><p>"Ren."</p><p>As I emerged from the training room, the first thing I noticed was Angelica making her way in my direction.</p><p>She had a rather serious expression on her face, and my face changed when I noticed this.</p><p>"What's wrong? Did something happen?"</p><p>"No, not really."</p><p>Angelica shook her head.</p><p>After that, she reached out her hand, at which point a dark radiance emanated from her and covered her entire arm. I was taken aback by her behaviour at first, but then I understood exactly what it was that she was attempting to let me see.</p><p>"You're about to break through to Duke rank?"</p><p>"Correct."</p><p>Angelica nodded her head, retrieving her hand and lowering it.</p><p>"I've been close to breaking through for quite a while now, but I haven't had the opportunity to do so."</p><p>"…and you've found that opportunity?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Angelica shook her head, a complicated look flashing across her face as she explained.</p><p>"I'm speaking with you because I have not yet discovered that opportunity. It appears that the demonic energy on earth is too weak for me to be of any help to me."</p><p>"Right…"</p><p>Indeed, earth was the last planet that the demons had set foot on, and the demonic energy was at a drastically lower level than that of Immorra and the other planets that had been conquered.</p><p>Angelica was facing a similar situation to what I was facing when I was back in Immorra, trying to break through.</p><p>"Do you not have enough devil fruits or something?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Angelica shook her head once more.</p><p>"Not of the level that can help me break through to the Duke rank."</p><p>My brows knit.</p><p>Her problem was indeed a big one. Her breaking through to Duke rank would be an enormous boost to our overall power. If possible, I wanted to help her break through as soon as possible.</p><p>When I turned my attention back to her, I could see that she was in her own thoughts.</p><p>'Looks like my days are going to become harder.'</p><p>I sighed internally as I came to the realization that she most likely already had a solution in mind, one that it was highly likely that I would not like. I then asked.</p><p>"You seem to have an idea in mind, mind sharing it with me?"</p><p>"…I plan on returning to the Demon realm."</p><p>I took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a moment to process the information.</p><p>'As expected…'</p><p>To be honest, I had a feeling that she would say something like this. Opening my eyes again and looking at her, I nodded my head.</p><p>"Do you know how to get there? Will you be able to go there unnoticed? I remember that your family is quite important there... There shouldn't be any problems, right?"</p><p>Angelica's eyes dulled, and she looked at me strangely.</p><p>"What's with all the questions, are you my mom?"</p><p>I scratched my cheek in embarrassment.</p><p>"Well, I don't want anything to happen to any of you. It's not like I can help it…"</p><p>"Pft…"</p><p>Angelica let out a strange sound and immediately followed it up by covering her mouth with her hand.</p><p>My eyes immediately squinted.</p><p>"Did you just laugh?"</p><p>"…You're imagining things."</p><p>Angelica feigned ignorance, and turned her head slightly.</p><p>This obviously didn't escape my line of sight.</p><p>"No, I really don't think so."</p><p>That was without a doubt a laugh.</p><p>Yet, Angelica kept her face straight as she looked at me. In the need, I could only relent at her indifference.</p><p>I waved my hand and gestured for her to leave.</p><p>"Alright, go…go, just make sure to come back in three months. That's most likely when I'll finally start to make my move. I'd like it if you were there during that time."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Angelica nodded her head and turned around.</p><p>"I'll be leaving in five days, once the dungeons will start to overload I'll use the chance to go back. I'll help as much as I can before that."</p><p>"Alright, thanks."</p><p>After that, Angelica left, and the environment around me became very quiet. Before I went into my private room, I raised my hand and took out a veil that was filled with a dark liquid.</p><p>Complicated thoughts flashed before my eyes when I stared at the vial.</p><p>'I guess I should also get ready.'</p><p>These were going to be three long months.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-672.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-674.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

        <p>As I watched the demon place his hand against Melissa's hand, everyone's eyes turned white.</p><p>'What's going on?'</p><p>Their sudden actions startled me as I tried to understand what was going on, but before I knew it, my vision darkened and I was suddenly transported inside a dark space.</p><p>'Where am I? What's going on?'</p><p>Just like before, I couldn't move my body.</p><p>I felt completely trapped.</p><p>As I stared into the blackness before me while wondering about what was going on, I noticed that it had started to change, and it was not long before my surroundings started to change as well.</p><p>Suddenly, white tiles appeared in the air and shot toward the ground before they neatly positioned themselves together.</p><p>That wasn't all.</p><p>Also, desks began to form in the air before positioning themselves in what appeared to be a medium-sized room. About half the size of a standard living room.</p><p>Books, files, glass panels, and awards?</p><p>…one by one a room started to form and my height suddenly started to shrink.</p><p>I had many questions that I wanted to ask, but my body was immobile. The only thing I could do at the moment was just watch as a scene unfolded in front of me.</p><p>In just a few minutes, everything was set up, and by the time the last tile was placed on the floor, everything seemed to look gigantic.</p><p>'No, rather, it isn't the surroundings that are gigantic, but it's me.'</p><p>I came to this realization when I found that I was holding onto what seemed to be a small drawing that I couldn't quite understand. They looked like doodles, yet at the same time didn't.</p><p>'What happened to my hands?"</p><p>Most notable about the situation was the fact that the hands holding only the paper seemed to belong to a child.</p><p>Their size…</p><p>They weren't even a quarter of what my hands looked like.</p><p>They were quite frankly tiny.</p><p>The confusion within me only grew as time passed, but I didn't have much time to ponder over the matters as the door of the room suddenly opened.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>'Eh?'</p><p>A familiar figure emerged from behind the door.</p><p>It only took several seconds for me to recognize the figure, and when I did, I was left in a state of shock.</p><p>'Octavious?'</p><p>He looked exactly the same as the Octavious I knew. But why was he here? What exactly was going on?</p><p>Amidst my shock at Octavious's sudden appearance, I realized that my body was shaking.</p><p>I felt a weird emotion surge from deep within. One that I couldn't quite describe.</p><p>What was it?</p><p>Excitement? Anxiety? Happiness?</p><p>I wasn't exactly sure.</p><p>Taking a timid step to the back, I hid the paper behind my back. All of the actions that occurred were not something that I could control, as the body moved on its own.</p><p>"Father."</p><p>Opening my mouth, what sounded like the voice of a little girl escaped from my mouth.</p><p>'Father? Octavious?'</p><p>It was at this moment that I finally realized that I was in what seemed to be Melissa's body, and the events that previously transpired before coming here started to flood my mind.</p><p>'Right, didn't the demon say something about breaking pride? Is this what he meant?'</p><p>When I realized that I was seeing her memories, I realized that perhaps everyone else was also seeing the same thing.</p><p>'…This is bad.'</p><p>I thought to myself as I tried to move the body in any way.</p><p> In an attempt to stop what was happening, I tried to come up with anything, but my efforts proved ineffective. </p><p>It was simply impossible.</p><p>What was even worse was the fact that I was forced to watch the entire thing as I couldn't close my eyes nor turn my body away.</p><p>"Father?"</p><p>The man's feet never stopped moving toward the desk that sat all the way across the room despite the girls' calls.</p><p>Once he arrived at his desk, pushing the chair back, Octavious sat down on the chair and started to look through a stack of papers. Completely disregarding the girl's existence.</p><p>In the meantime, my feet gingerly headed toward his desk. Coming to the side of the desk, and finally getting a glimpse of Octavious's side view, my head raised a little, until I was finally get a good look at Octavious's face.</p><p>Once again, I felt a weird feeling enshroud my body.</p><p>This time, I could make out what it wash</p><p>'Anticipation.'</p><p>The feeling that I was feeling right now was that of anticipation.</p><p>Anticipation of him noticing me.</p><p>...but that never happened as thirty minutes soon elapsed.</p><p>In the thirty or so minutes that passed, not once did Octavious ever turn to face me as I timidly stared at his serious features.</p><p>In that span of time, I could feel my feet start to hurt.</p><p>Before I knew it, my body took a step forward and my little hand clasped onto his trousers.</p><p>"Let go."</p><p>As my hand touched his trousers, Octavious's words echoed. Immediately, I let go of his trousers.</p><p>"What do you want?"</p><p>Finally getting his attention, he lowered his head to stare at me.</p><p>'Those eyes…they are the same as now.'</p><p>Closely observing his eyes, I realized he hadn't changed since this event happened all those years ago. They were still as hallow and lifeless as they were now.</p><p>"Um…"</p><p>Exerting more force onto the grip of the paper behind my back, my body shifted toward the right and left before I took out the paper and handed it to him.</p><p>"Here."</p><p>I felt hints of shyness coming from my body when I handed him the paper. Clearly, it meant a lot to the little girl.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>Taking a look at the paper, Octavious grabbed it and examined it for several seconds.</p><p>"A scribble?"</p><p>He asked.</p><p>My head immediately shook.</p><p>"No."</p><p>"No? Then what is this? Some sort of molecular structure."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>A feeling of elation swept my body as my hands shyly twirled behind my back. A bright smile also spread across my face.</p><p>"Uncle Thompson told me that I just discovered something amazing and wanted me to show you."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>Taking another look at the paper, Octavious quickly lost interest and crumbled the paper in his hand.</p><p>The smile on my face froze, and my eyes blinked a couple of times. It was only after Octavious tossed the paper in the trash that he everything finally sank into the little girl's mind as my head raised up.</p><p>"Don't disturb me with this nonsense again. Get out of my room."</p><p>Before I could even reply, Octavious waved his hand, and I felt my body shoot up in the air.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>The door burst open and I shot toward the room's entrance.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>With a loud sound, the door behind me closed shut and my body suddenly started to enlarge before I dropped to the ground.</p><p>"Haaa…haaa…"</p><p>Drip—! Drip—!</p><p>I gasped for air heavily as sweat dripped from my face and hair covered my vision while they scattered on the ground where I lay.</p><p>Every part of my body burned, and I could barely move my muscles, but…</p><p>"Again."</p><p>My hand moved toward the right and tightly clenched what seemed to be a long pole.</p><p>'A spear.'</p><p>I thought.</p><p>Feeling the grip of the pole, I used it to support my body up and it was then that I was able to see where I was exactly.</p><p>'A training room.'</p><p>At the moment, I was standing in a white room with wooden tiles at the bottom. The room was surrounded by large glass panels, and from there I could see the reflection of a familiar figure.</p><p>'…Is this really Melissa?'</p><p>She looked nothing like herself, with wet hair falling behind her back, no glasses, and sweat dripping down her face. It was as if she had become a completely new person.</p><p>Especially since the Melissa that I knew disliked exercising.</p><p>"How about it young miss? Should we stop for now?"</p><p>Right then, my eyesight focused on a female figure wearing a black suit standing opposite of her. She had short black hair, an oval-looking face, a small nose, and large eyes.</p><p>She was stunning.</p><p>As she pointed the tip of a long spear at me, her heroic and charming figure appeared especially impressive.</p><p>"You look exhausted, it's best if you don't continue training."</p><p>"No."</p><p>Melissa shook her head, as I felt the grasp of the spear tighten.</p><p>"We're not stopping until I pass out."</p><p>Taking a step forward, she charged to where the female combatant was and firmly thrust the spear in her direction.</p><p>Her movements were rather smooth and sharp. In no time they reached the lady standing on the opposite end, but…</p><p>A casual swipe of her hand deflected Melissa's attack and redirected it toward the ground.</p><p>"Sloppy."</p><p>The lady murmured before I felt a kick on the back of my leg and I dropped to the ground.</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>A small groan escaped my lips as I fell to the ground. My body seemed to have lost all of its energy as I dropped several times to the ground as I tried to get up, but in spite of my best efforts, I couldn't get up.</p><p>"D..Damn it, not yet!"</p><p>"Give up young miss."</p><p>The lady from before spoke. Her words only served to incite a hidden anger that rushed out from within my body.</p><p>Glaring at the lady, I spat through my gnashed teeth.</p><p>"I said, only stop when I pass out!"</p><p>Her threatening aura seemed to have worked somewhat, as the lady stopped insisting that she'd give up and just let her do her thing.</p><p>"As you wish."</p><p>Taking a step forward, the servant disappeared from the spot before reappearing right in front of me. Her movements were lightning quick, and although I could react to them, my body couldn't, and was soon thrown all the way toward the other end of the training ground.</p><p>Crash—!</p><p>My body quickly crashed against the walls.</p><p>I had originally expected to feel some pain while I crashed against the wall, but to my surprise, I didn't.</p><p>It seemed as though we couldn't feel pain in this imaginary world.</p><p>Nonetheless, I may not be able to feel pain, but I could still feel what Melissa was feeling.</p><p>Frustration, anger, and resentment.</p><p>Drip—! Drip—!</p><p>With more sweat dripping from her forehead, I slowly raised my head and glared at the lady.</p><p>"Again!"</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-588.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-590.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

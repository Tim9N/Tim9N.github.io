        <p>If there was anything that changed during the two years I devoted to training, it was my combat approach.</p><p>Even while I continued to use the Keiki style as I had in the past, I was able to modify it in my own unique way.</p><p>I didn't need to grip my sword and hang on to the sheath like I had in the past.</p><p>The only thing I needed to do now was to gently tap my finger in the air.</p><p>When I sheathed and unsheathed my sword, the speed at which I could do so increased to the point where those of a high level could no longer see it with their unaided eyes. To those on the outside, it appeared as though I was simply pointing at my enemies and killing them, but in reality, I was actually doing the same movement as in the past, but a lot faster.</p><p>But it wasn't just that.</p><p>I was also able to tap into a new power.</p><p>Mana agglomeration.</p><p>Typically, one would form an armor when reaching this level. Sort of like Monica with her shining orange armor.</p><p>...I knew this because she tended to show this off quite often. Liam could also somewhat do it, although his armor was a bit strange.</p><p>How could I describe it? ...Let's just say that it is severely lacking in the defensive department with gaping holes everywhere.</p><p>In any case, it was different for me.</p><p>Unlike them, I never created an armor for myself. Rather, I came up with something else.</p><p>Mana aggregation functioned by physically bending the mana in the air to your will and controlling it in such a way that you could make it into a tangible material that could be used to cover the human body as armor.</p><p>I could now summon actual sword energy out of thin air by bending the mana in the air to my desire.</p><p>Due to my two-year research of the psyon composition in the air and the pill I took after returning from the conference, I was able to regulate my psyons to an extreme degree, which was necessary for my new technique.</p><p>In a way, I was confident in facing any opponent of the &lt;S+&gt; rank range without feeling the littlest of intimidation from them.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>I was jolted out of my thoughts by the presence of several shadows in the air. Squinting my eyes, I casually tapped the air.</p><p>Thump! Thump!</p><p>The two shadows fell from the sky after I pointed in their direction, revealing the figures of a couple of demons.</p><p>They crashed against the hard ground, sending dirt flying in the air.</p><p>At the moment, over ten different birds, each with a different size and strength, were circling the skies above us. I glanced at Ava as we walked silently side by side in their direction.</p><p>"Quick question Ava, how many beasts can you control at the same time at the moment."</p><p>"About forty."</p><p>Ava replied, leaving me impressed.</p><p>Forty beasts at the same time…that was practically a small army.</p><p>It looks like she has made a lot of progress over the past few years.</p><p>She was the only one I hadn't sparred with because she was out searching for monsters to tame, unlike the others who didn't need to do that.</p><p>It also explained why I didn't know how many beasts she could summon at the same time.</p><p>"You're rank is &lt;B+&gt;, right?"</p><p>"Right."</p><p>Ava nodded her head, and I fell into deep contemplation.</p><p>Eventually, my eyes paused on the flute that was in her hands.</p><p>"I see…so does that mean you're about to unlock the third seal of your flute."</p><p>"Mhm."</p><p>Ava confirmed.</p><p>"When I reach &lt;A-&gt; rank, I will be able to break the next seal and have the chance to take more beasts and help them improve faster."</p><p>There were hints of visible excitement in her voice when she said the last words. Clearly, she loved the idea of her and her pets becoming stronger.</p><p>With her being in my group, I was naturally pleased with this development.</p><p>"That's good, keep up th—"</p><p>I wasn't even able to finish when I heard someone's voice coming from the distance.</p><p>"Ren, I can see the fortress and castle in the distance. What should we do now?"</p><p>The voice belonged to none other than Ryan who seemed a lot more comfortable walking around. At least compared to when he first arrived here.</p><p>With my feet coming to a halt, I thought for a moment before shifting my attention toward Angelica.</p><p>"Call for him."</p><p>"Got it."</p><p>Wearing a solemn look on her face, Angelica closed her eyes.</p><p>***</p><p>At the same time, in the said castle.</p><p>The empty, yet grandiose halls within the castle were currently filled with several figures.</p><p>All of them were the highest ranking members of the orcen race left in Immorra.</p><p>Silug sat on a big throne at the opposite end of the room. The hall was completely or at least partially surrounded by his presence as another, slightly lesser presence also filled the hallways.</p><p>It belonged to none other than Omgolung, the previous orcen chief.</p><p>All of the orcen delegates attention was currently fixated on Omgolung, and the entire room was dead silent. The arrival of the former chief caused some people to express obvious happiness, shock, and sadness.</p><p>Nonetheless, it wasn't something they could vividly show as they all focused their attention back on Silug who quietly saw on the throne without saying anything.</p><p>"Khrrr…khrrr…"</p><p>His labored breathing resonated across the space, shaking it along with him.</p><p>"Prepare yourselves."</p><p>He finally spoke, allowing for his deep and coarse voice to echo throughout the entire room.</p><p>Pressing both of his hands on the side arms of the throne, he slowly stood up from his seat and scanned everyone in the hall with his eyes.</p><p>His physique exuded a deep green tint that heightened the tension already present in the space.</p><p> None of the orcs present dared to move a muscle as they all focused their attention on Silug who was about to speak.</p><p>His next words stirred the heart of everyone present.</p><p>"It's time for us to start another war. It is time for us to take the initiative and recapture some of the territories we have lost."</p><p>Shifting his attention toward Omgolung, Silug announced.</p><p>"Omgolung will lead the army going forward as its top general. He'll be running the army, and his words will count just as much as mine."</p><p>The entire hall stirred as they looked at Omgulong, a figure whom they used to follow in the past.</p><p>Sure, he was a lot skinnier and weaker than back then, but the presence he gave out did not lose out from the one Silug gave out.</p><p>They happily accepted Silug's orders.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>All the representatives shouted in unison.</p><p>Silug was left satisfied when he saw this.</p><p>"That's good. I would like it for you all to prepare for war. Starting tomorrow we will officially go to—"</p><p>Silug stopped himself mid-sentence, and his face changed.</p><p>This obviously did not go unnoticed by the orcs who looked at each other and wondered what was going on.</p><p>It was unusual for Silug to behave this way.</p><p>Just as someone was about to voice out their concerns, Silug's deep voice echoed throughout the halls. His expression was unusually serious.</p><p>"We have guests. Someone go and receive them."</p><p>***</p><p>Ten minutes after sending a message to Silug, we headed toward the castle in the distance.</p><p>We didn't make it far before we were forced to stop.</p><p>"It looks extremely guarded."</p><p>At the base of the castle, hundreds of orcs appeared in my vision. A number of spartan stone homes could be seen behind them.</p><p>They seemed to be the first line of defense.</p><p>"What should we do now?"</p><p>Leopold asked while he gazed at the numerous orcs in the distance.</p><p>"...Please don't tell me that we have to directly break through their formation because I don't think—"</p><p>"We won't."</p><p>I cut Leopold out of his delusions.</p><p>Then, squinting my eyes, I scanned the distance.</p><p>"Just wait here for now. If my estimates aren't wrong, we will be escorted into the castle in a bit."</p><p>"Escorted?"</p><p>Leopold's face was filled with doubt as he looked at the orcs in the distance.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yes, really."</p><p>I couldn't blame Leopold for being doubtful.</p><p>I would likewise be skeptical after getting a good look at how menacing the orcs in the distance appeared.</p><p>Thankfully, we didn't have to wait for long as a group of orcs descended down the mountain. Their entire presence was a stark above the guards guarding the base, and in their immediate presence, the orcs all lowered their heads as a form of respect.</p><p>It was their presence that signaled to me that they were the guard that was meant to escort us to the top.</p><p>Hence, looking at the others, I nudged them with my head before directly heading to where the orcs were.</p><p>"Let's go."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-618.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-620.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

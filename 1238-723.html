        <p>"Huh?"</p><p>"W-what?"</p><p>"Am I seeing things?"</p><p>The astonishment that we felt the instant that we set foot back on earth could not be adequately described using any words at all. I was so shocked that the after effects of the portal seemed like nothing to me.</p><p>Greeting us at the portal was Kevin. Everything seemed normal from that point. He was currently wearing a nice suit, which I had to say, made him look rather dashing.</p><p>I wasn't jealous.</p><p>That said…</p><p>"What did you do?"</p><p>As I emerged from the training area, I was taken aback to see that the headquarters was packed to the gills with individuals.</p><p>If that wasn't surprising enough, I couldn't believe how many people there were outside. When I looked out the window at the street below, I couldn't believe how crowded it was.</p><p>…It was as if the war had never started in the first place.</p><p>I was baffled, and so were the others.</p><p>'What happened in the time we were in Melandoir?'</p><p>"Surprised?"</p><p>Kevin looked at us with a smirk, leading us up toward his office.</p><p>"I won't hold you guys up for long. I just need to brief you on the situation, and you can all be on your way."</p><p>"Good morning, Alliance head."</p><p>"Have a safe day, Alliance head."</p><p>The manner in which people greeted Kevin on our way to his office was by far the most perplexing thing that I noticed.</p><p>Their eyes… they were filled with reverence.</p><p>My brows immediately furrowed when I saw this.</p><p>…I slowly started to get an idea of what had happened, and I felt my heart drop for some reason.</p><p>Everything seemed to be too good to be true.</p><p>"Come, relax in my office for a bit."</p><p>As we entered Kevin's office, he graciously offered us a few drinks before taking a seat in one of the chairs there.</p><p>"What happened?"</p><p>Jin was the first one to speak, asking the question that was lingering in the minds of everyone present.</p><p>I just quietly observed Kevin from my seat.</p><p>The more looked at him, the more I felt that things were off.</p><p>Nonetheless, I still quietly listened to the conversation. I could just be overthinking things, though I doubted it.</p><p>"We got lucky, and we managed to defeat all of the high ranking members of the Monolith. Of course, we didn't completely rid of the entire organization, as some went into hiding, but we were able to deal a large glow to them."</p><p>Kevin looked at me and smiled.</p><p>"It was no thanks to your help."</p><p>'What is he on about?'</p><p>Everyone looked at me, and Kevin elaborated.</p><p>"Had it not been for your letter before you left, we would've fallen for their trap. Thankfully, we managed to turn the situation around and reverse the trap by sending all of our high ranking members out. It was a risk, but it paid off."</p><p>He spoke in such a nonchalant tone that it made it seem as though he had dealt with a trivial matter.</p><p>Still, that didn't explain everything. I understood how he defeated the elders, but what about Hemlock?</p><p>He was the type of guy to die despite falling for an ambush.</p><p>Thinking there, I looked at Kevin to ask, but…</p><p>"What about Mal—"</p><p>"What's up with you guys? Why do I feel demonic energy all over your body?"</p><p>I was interrupted by Kevin, who stood up and looked at us with a frown. After he waved his hand once, a shadowy radiance began to emanate from each person's body.</p><p>He turned his head to look at me.</p><p>"Seriously?"</p><p>He wasn't impressed.</p><p>I shrugged.</p><p>"I had no choice. The demonic energy was far too thick over there. I wouldn't have made them sign a contract if they could've handled it."</p><p>"Haaa…"</p><p>Kevin let out a long sigh.</p><p>"This is rather troubling."</p><p>He grumbled.</p><p>"You do know that while we won the war, the situation is still rather sensitive? I understand you, since everyone knows you and they probably can't beat you, but then?"</p><p>Kevin alternated his gaze between Melissa, Jin, and Amanda.</p><p>"Let alone their positions, they can't even hide their demonic energy properly. It's practically leaking out of their bodies. Thankfully, you're with me, and even if the others noticed, they wouldn't have said anything."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>Perhaps it's because I became accustomed to the other world, but I honestly didn't even notice that they were leaking demonic energy.</p><p>Melissa looked at her arms and frowned. She then turned to look at me.</p><p>"Get rid of it."</p><p>I was speechless.</p><p>"…You do know I can't just get rid of it at the snap of my fingers, right?"</p><p>She had signed a contract. The demonic energy would linger until the contract expired.</p><p>"Don't worry though, since I already knew when we were going to come back, the contracts will expire in a few hours, so you won't have to wait for long."</p><p>Actually, if there was anyone who was looking forward to the expiration of the contract more than I was, it was going to be me.</p><p>…this whole experience traumatized me in ways that I thought weren't possible.</p><p>Never again will I offer contracts to others.</p><p>Especially the lot of them…</p><p>"Alright then. Since we've got all of this sorted, I'll have you guys rest in the rooms I have prepared for you."</p><p>Kevin stood up and pressed the phone on his desk.</p><p>"Once the contract expires and you get over the side effects, you're free to go."</p><p>Clank—</p><p>"You called me?"</p><p>Almost immediately after that, Emma burst into the room in an abrupt manner. As she looked around and noticed us, a change came over her expression.</p><p>"What are you guys doing here?"</p><p>"It's a long story."</p><p>Kevin said with a smile. Fixing his tie, he fell back into his chair and lazily turned.</p><p>"Arrange the lot of them in a room. Don't bother asking any questions, they probably won't answer."</p><p>"Uhh."</p><p>A worried expression appeared on Emma's face. As she turned her head, her gaze eventually fell on Amanda, and she let out a sigh at that point.</p><p>"Alright then. Come with me for now."</p><p>She turned around and left. Standing up, everyone but me followed her.</p><p>I waved at them before they could ask anything.</p><p>"Don't mind me, I still have something to talk to with Kevin."</p><p>Emma's feet came to a sudden pause and she turned to look at Kevin.</p><p>"It's alright."</p><p> He waved at her, and she nodded. She never once bothered to glance in my direction throughout the entire time.</p><p>I didn't even need to think of why she was acting the way that she was. Just a look in Kevin's direction, and I knew she was still holding a grudge against me.</p><p>…How petty.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>The door closed, and silence reigned over the office space.</p><p>Kevin eventually got to his feet and moved to the large window that was behind him. There, he turned his attention to Ashton City.</p><p>"Want some tea?"</p><p>"Only now do you offer?"</p><p>He had all the time before to offer, and only when the two of us were alone did he offer?</p><p>Kevin laughed a bit.</p><p>"Tea's expensive."</p><p>"…Did you gamble all your money away?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Then…?"</p><p>"Emma."</p><p>It was a short answer. But then everything became clear to me, and I stopped talking.</p><p>"Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p>"No, I understand."</p><p>"Stop looking at me like that…"</p><p>"No, I get it. Don't worry. I'm not pitying you."</p><p>"Your looks say otherwise."</p><p>"Does it?"</p><p>…and here I thought I was keeping a very good poker face.</p><p>What a shame.</p><p>"…"</p><p>The room fell back into its customary state of silence. Although it wasn't awkward, the situation was definitely tense.</p><p>In the end, I was the one who broke the silence.</p><p>"…You don't expect me to believe in the same bullshit you fed the others, right? What did you actually do?"</p><p>I knew Kevin… or I thought I did after some point.</p><p>He wasn't someone capable of defeating Malik Alshayatin. Even with Octavious's help.</p><p>…The whole situation was rather fishy.</p><p>"Heh."</p><p>Kevin chuckled to himself.</p><p>I frowned.</p><p>"What's so funny?"</p><p>There was nothing funny about what I said.</p><p>"I may have fooled the others, but I certainly can't fool you."</p><p>Kevin turned around and smiled.</p><p>…It was a sincere smile.</p><p>"Say, would you mind coming with me somewhere? I'd like to show you something."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-722.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-724.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

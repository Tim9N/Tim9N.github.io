        <p>'...I've been used.'</p><p>Coming out of the dream, Angelica didn't know how to look at Ren at the moment.</p><p>Realizing that she was merely someone that was purposely made to sign a contract with Ren with the purpose of damaging his soul, Angelica's emotions were in a state of disarray.</p><p>In a way, she felt betrayed, and at the same time, she didn't. From the very beginning, she had known that there was something secret about him.</p><p>From the way that he knew certain things, and the fight he previously had with the Demon King not too long ago.</p><p>She knew that he was hiding something.</p><p>...She just didn't know that it was this sort of secret.</p><p>'Who am I to judge?'</p><p>Angelica inwardly shook her head while she took her eyes away from him.</p><p>In reality, she had also been using him.</p><p>He was the reason for her outstanding growth and that was why she decided to stay with him. She realized that it would be hypocritical of her to not admit this much.</p><p>Nonetheless, she still couldn't get rid of the weird feeling that was taking over her body.</p><p>It was really uncomfortable.</p><p>Tap.</p><p>It was at that moment that Angelica heard the soft echo of a footstep.</p><p>Raising her head, she saw Ren appear in front of the demon responsible for all of this. At the moment, he seemed to have lost his soul as he mumbled to himself and continued to stare toward the ground.</p><p>Looking at him, Angelica knew exactly how he felt.</p><p>As a devout believer of the Demon King, Angelica knew that his world must've come crashing down on her when he saw Ren defeat him in one of his visions.</p><p>His reaction made even more sense of the fact that he was from the pride clan. With his pride now shattered, he was a husk of his former self.</p><p>Crack.</p><p>With just a squeeze of his hands, Angelica watched as Ren ended the life of a Prince-ranked demon.</p><p>Taking particular note of Ren's expression while he squeezed the demon's neck, Angelica began to lower her head.</p><p>Blinking her eyes a couple of times, and recalling the expression his face had while he squeezed the demon's neck, Angelica realized something.</p><p>'He's in pain.'</p><p>***</p><p>"…He's coming."</p><p>I muttered while I stared at the distant ceiling.</p><p>It wasn't very obvious, but I could feel Jezebeth's power coming my way. It wouldn't be long before he arrived here.</p><p>The tightening of my heart was proof of that.</p><p>Turning my head to look at the others, my eyes paused on Kevin. Our eyes met.</p><p>Looking back at me, he had a rather complicated look on his face.</p><p>Nevertheless, he nodded his head. He understood what my words meant.</p><p>"I can only bring three people with me."</p><p>"Bring Ryan, and Smallsnake with you."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Our conversation probably didn't make sense to the others, but what I wanted at the moment was for Kevin to leave this place as fast as possible.</p><p>The Demon King was about to come. He and the others weren't safe at the moment, and it was best if they left at the moment.</p><p>There was only one problem at the moment, and that was the fact that Kevin could only bring three people with him. It was something that both of us understood.</p><p>It was a good thing that Kevin wasn't the only option we had available in order to leave this place. Further down, there should be a portal that we could use to make our escape.</p><p>Nevertheless, it was best if Smallsnake and Ryan left with Kevin first, since it would take time for us to reach the portals and activate them.</p><p>Without them, it would make things more efficient for everyone.</p><p>"Make sure to tell me the coordinates of earth before you leave. We'll be stuck here if you don't."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Nodding his head, Kevin raised his palm to face the distance. His body began to take on a red hue.</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>Just as more and more energy began to gather toward Kevin, someone spoke up.</p><p>Turning my head, I spotted Smallsnake moving in my direction. My heart unconsciously sped up when I met his gaze.</p><p>I let out a sigh of relief not long after.</p><p>The way he looked at me was no different from how he looked at me back in the past.</p><p> Pausing a couple of steps in front of me, he spoke.</p><p>"Ren, wait a second."</p><p>"What is it?"</p><p>I asked, while my brows furrowed.</p><p>"I know what you are planning to do, and I don't think sending Ryan and I first will be a good idea."</p><p>"How so?"</p><p>I curiously asked while raising my brow.</p><p>Turning his head to stare at Ryan who was behind Angelica, Smallsnake sighed.</p><p>"Actually, if you're thinking of sending us away first because you think we're too weak, then it's the wrong decision."</p><p>Calmly listening to Smallsnake's words, I tried to understand what he was trying to say.</p><p>At the moment, his words didn't particularly make sense.</p><p>How was the decision of sending the two weakest people away, the wrong decision? What I was doing was obviously for their sake.</p><p>'I need to hurry up.'</p><p>As I brushed my hair back, I felt the sense of doom gripping my heart increase.</p><p>'He's close.'</p><p>The sense of urgency increased, while cold sweat dripped from the side of my face.</p><p>"Smallsnake, we really don't have much time to discuss this. Just tell me what you want to say."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>With a solemn look on his face, Smallsnake hurriedly nodded his head.</p><p>"As I mentioned, sending Ryan and I away isn't the best solution. If there is anyone that can connect the coordinates faster and fine-tune the portal, it is us. Rather than slowing you down, we will make everything faster."</p><p>"Hmm…"</p><p>The frown on my face tightened after hearing his words.</p><p>'He has a point.'</p><p>I thought after a while activating 'Eyes of Chronos' to slow down time.</p><p>'Having been trained by Jomnuk in Henlour, Smallsnake and Ryan are probably very knowledgeable regarding this kind of stuff, and their assistance will certainly be of value...'</p><p>'No, rather, their assistance will definitely be useful, and perhaps even save me a lot of valuable time.'</p><p>I deactivated 'Eyes of Chronos', and looked at Smallsnake.</p><p>"Alright, we'll do as you say."</p><p>My decision was made within the span of a couple of seconds.</p><p>Lifting my head and staring at the others who were all looking at me, I took a deep breath.</p><p>Then, taking a step toward the exit of the room I started to speak.</p><p>"All of you probably have a lot of questions for me. Especially after what you've seen in the visions, but I've just figured it out myself. I'm just as clueless as all of you are."</p><p>Sort of.</p><p>Although I already had an idea of what was going on, I didn't know it was to this extent.</p><p>"It's not the right time to ask questions right now. Let's get out of this planet before we figure everything ou—"</p><p>Cutting myself mid-sentence, I turned to look toward the entrance of the door and it was there that I spotted a familiar figure.</p><p>It was Han Yufei. He had a rather confused look on his face at the moment.</p><p>"Have you managed to get the dimensional spaces?"</p><p>I asked.</p><p>In a moment of contemplation, Han Yufei turned his head and stared at the room before looking back at me.</p><p>"I have searched the lower levels, and I have found no evidence of dimensional spaces being there. However, I have released several different prisoners, and they should now be attracting the attention of some of the demons that are standing guard below..."</p><p>Pausing his sight on the room and staring at our clothes and bodies which were all roughed up, Han Yufei curiously asked.</p><p>"Been meaning to ask, did something happen while I was gone?"</p><p>'This is problematic.'</p><p>Covering my chin to ponder, I no longer paid any attention to Han Yufei.</p><p>The sudden revelation that he didn't have the dimensional spaces made my toes curl with anxiety.</p><p>'This is really bad. Should I just leave without my dimensional space?'</p><p>The search for dimensional spaces might end in my death, but at the same time, losing my dimensional space was almost like cutting my strength in half...There would be no way for me to end the loop or whatever was happening without my dimensional space.</p><p>Either way, I was screwed.</p><p>Scratching the side of my face in a rushed manner, I clenched my fists tightly and came up with a decision.</p><p>'Shit, I can't leave without my dimensional space. All my most important stuff is there. Without it, I'd be screwed.'</p><p>Quite literally screwed.</p><p>Setting aside my sword which was a progressively growing artifact, there were many other things inside of my dimensional space that I just couldn't get rid of.</p><p>Their loss would result in my losing a considerable amount of power.</p><p>'I need to go get them.'</p><p>I made my decision within a split second.</p><p>"Han Yufei, do you have any idea where the dimensional space is located?"</p><p>Since he's searched all of the bottom levels, he must've gotten an idea.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Han Yufei nodded his head.</p><p>"The dimensional spaces are located one floor above, right in the room above us. Since I've searched the whole place, I'm quite confident in my deduction."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>I turned to face the exit without hesitation. Whether his words were true or not, I didn't have a choice at the moment.</p><p>As I was pressed for time, I didn't have the luxury of pondering over everything.</p><p>Once again turning to look at Kevin, I opened my mouth.</p><p>"Kevin, bring whoever you want back to earth, the others, follow Angelica."</p><p>My eyes paused on her.</p><p>If there was anyone that would know where the portal was located, it was her.</p><p>Meeting my line of sight, Angelica wordlessly stared at me for a couple of seconds before grabbing Ryan's hands and nodding her head.</p><p>"Understood."</p><p>Her soft voice reached my ears, prompting me to feel more relaxed.</p><p>"Kh."</p><p>But that didn't last for long as I suddenly felt my hand twitch, and pain engulf my body.</p><p>'Shit, it hurts.'</p><p>In that short moment when I killed Magnus, my strength soared up uncontrollably, however, it was only temporary.</p><p>My current body was still too weak to handle all of his powers.</p><p>Nevertheless, I could take consolation in the fact that my current body could withstand the power more easily than before.</p><p>In fact, though I wasn't exactly sure, I think I may have already broken to &lt;S-&gt; rank. Normally, I would've been happy with this piece of news, but at the moment, I think I may have lost such emotion.</p><p>With everything that had happened to me... happiness was no longer something that I could find.</p><p>'I can't waste any more time.'</p><p>Taking my attention away from my strength, I proceeded to make my way out of the room.</p><p>As I was about to leave, a hand pressed against my shoulder.</p><p>"Wait."</p><p>A soft and crisp voice echoed through my ear.</p><p>I didn't need to look to understand who the voice belonged. My heart tightened.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>I asked while hiding the expression on my face.</p><p>"We need to talk."</p><p>"Later, there isn't time for us to talk."</p><p>The demon king could come any minute now. There was no time to talk.</p><p>"I'm going to go and get a couple of things fir—"</p><p>"I'll come with you then."</p><p>My brows furrowed when I heard her words.</p><p>Turning around, and just as I was about to reject her, my facial features froze.</p><p>Blankly staring into her eyes and pursing my lips, I nodded my head.</p><p>"Alright, come with me."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>She softly whispered while tugging at the edge of my shirt.</p><p>Closing my eyes once, I turned around and left the room.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-597.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-599.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

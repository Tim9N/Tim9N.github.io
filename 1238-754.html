        <p>'I kind of understand why those in power always like to have a window behind their office.'</p><p>I felt my shoulders drop and my body loosen up as I stood at the window and looked down at Ashton City.</p><p>Staring at the city that was once again filled with people, I found myself relaxing. The view… It wasn't so different from the world I just came from.</p><p>"Haa..."</p><p>I inevitably let out a sigh. Even though the view was beautiful, I couldn't help but feel a rush of a variety of different emotions whenever I thought about the one responsible for making this whole thing possible.</p><p>'Are you really finding that everyone is forgetting about you, Kevin?'</p><p>It rubbed me the wrong way a little bit that everyone was going about their day, celebrating the peace, and yet they had no idea who it was that made it this way. What irritated me the most was the fact that I was getting all of the credits that were supposed to belong to Kevin.</p><p>Things weren't supposed to go this way...</p><p>I unknowingly found myself clenching my fist tightly. If… If there was a way to make everyone remember… I'd do it.</p><p>Ding―!</p><p>[Here's the information you've asked me to look for. I don't think I've missed anything out. If that's not enough, give me a message and I'll see what I can do.]</p><p>"As expected, Ryan's the best."</p><p>The message was attached to a small file, and when I opened it, I discovered that it contained a great deal of information along with a number of pictures. They were incredibly detailed and contained all the information I could possibly want.</p><p>He was indeed someone whom I personally recruited.</p><p>'...If only Smallsnake was still here.'</p><p>I felt my mood plummet thinking about him. If there was anyone else who was good at getting information, it'd be him.</p><p>To Tok―!</p><p>It was then that someone knocked on the door.</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>I sat myself back down in my chair.</p><p>"Did you call for me?"</p><p> A lethargic figure walked in. After entering the office, he took a quick survey of his surroundings before finding a seat in one of the chairs that were directly across from mine.</p><p>"Liam, It's nice to see that you were able to get here without a problem."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>He cocked his head to the side, confused.</p><p>"Was there supposed to be a problem?"</p><p>"…You say this when you can't even remember where the mercenary headquarters are."</p><p>Liam blinked a couple of times before leaning back on the chair.</p><p>"We had a mercenary headquarters?"</p><p>"…"</p><p>I pressed my hand against my forehead. As expected of Liam.</p><p>"Anyways…"</p><p>I rubbed both of my hands while taking a closer look at Liam. There was something I needed to check.</p><p>Perhaps taken aback by how long I was looking for or by my gaze, Liam sat up straight.</p><p>"Is something wrong? Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p>I didn't answer and continued to observe him. The longer I looked at him, the more certain I became of my assumption, and I noticed that my mood became more serious as a result.</p><p>'As expected… It really was the case...'</p><p>"Ren?"</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>It wasn't until that point that I finally became aware that Liam was standing in front of me, waving his hand in front of my face, that I snapped out of it.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"No… I thought there was something wrong with you since you weren't responding."</p><p>"I'm fine. Sit back down."</p><p>I waved at him and leaned back on my chair. After he had taken a seat, I rubbed the underside of my chin and lightly tapped my finger against the surface of the desk.</p><p>'The more I think about it, the more it makes perfect sense...'</p><p>"Liam."</p><p>I called out his name.</p><p>He cocked his head.</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"…I think I may have found the reason for your memory problems."</p><p>Upon hearing my words, Liam's eyes widened quite a bit, and before he could respond, I extended my hand in front of me, and all of a sudden, a white substance coated my hand.</p><p>'I should've realized it long before.'</p><p>"Stay still. Let me see the extent of the Laws that are placed within your body."</p><p>***</p><p>Swoosh―!</p><p>On a training ground that was otherwise empty, Emma practiced her swordplay with two short swords. Whenever she swung her blade, strands of her hair would fly into the air and land on her face, where they would become affixed to her skin due to the sweat that had accumulated.</p><p>She wasn't sure for how long she'd been at it, but it was only when she was completely gassed out that she finally stopped.</p><p>"Haaa…haaa…"</p><p>Her chest burned with each breath.</p><p>'I feel empty.'</p><p>For some inexplicable reason, Emma felt empty. She had no idea why she was unable to shake this feeling, but it had been plaguing her for the past few days, and she couldn't figure out how to get rid of it.</p><p>"Ha…What..haa… is wrong with me?"</p><p>The more she thought about that emptiness, the more she felt it turn into something else.</p><p>Pain?</p><p>She wasn't sure.</p><p>It was either that or something else. She just couldn't figure out what was bothering her.</p><p>"Fuck. I hate this."</p><p>Staring at her short swords, she stood up and resumed practice. It was the only thing that helped her ease her mind away from that empty feeling.</p><p>Swoosh―! Swoosh―!</p><p>Her short swords pierced through the air as her figure danced across the training grounds. Wherever she went, the sound of wind slicing accompanied her every movement.</p><p>She was fast, extremely so. Leaving behind afterimages of herself as she stabbed, slashed, and pierced through the air. Holding her breath, she increased the pace continuously. Her lungs were burning and her muscles were aching, but she continued.</p><p>She was in a state where the pain was what helped her relieve that 'feeling'. She looked forward for the pain.</p><p>This only lasted for five minutes, however…</p><p>Clank―!</p><p>Dropping both her weapons to the floor, Emma grabbed her shirt and wiped her face.</p><p>"Just what is wrong with me?"</p><p>She found herself unable to focus on her training. Whenever she tried, that feeling would resurface again, distracting her from her practice.</p><p>Drip―!</p><p>Feeling something drip down her cheek, Emma froze for a moment. Something stabbed her in the chest, and she found herself clenching her shirt.</p><p>"Why am I like this?"</p><p>What was going on with her? What was happening to her? Why was she like this?</p><p>"Fuck it."</p><p>Unable to find an answer, she kicked her swords away and headed for her room. She had enough training.</p><p>*</p><p>Following a speedy shower, Emma proceeded to detangle her hair while sitting in front of a sizable mirror. As she looked at her own reflection, she noticed that the empty feeling she was feeling was starting to dissipate.</p><p>"What was that?"</p><p>She wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or not by the fact that the feeling had gone away, but as she stared at herself in the mirror, she was startled to find that several tears were streaming down her cheeks.</p><p>"W,what's going on?!"</p><p>She stood up, wiping her tears with her sleeves.</p><p>"Why am I suddenly crying out of nowhere?"</p><p>Rubbing her eyes with her hand, she continued to wipe away the tears that were falling.</p><p>"Fuck."</p><p>Cursing out loud, Emma put the brush away and headed down the stairs of her house.</p><p>The house was rather empty, and by the time she took the last step toward the ground floor, she heard the sound of the door ringing.</p><p>Tong―!</p><p>"Is it dad?"</p><p>Surprised, she went ahead and opened the door.</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>What surprised her, however, was a sight completely different than she had expected. Standing in front of her was someone she knew all too well―not just her, perhaps the whole world―and raising his hand, he waved at her.</p><p>"Hi."</p><p>It was Ren.</p><p>***</p><p>I apologize for the lack of updates. I just recently flew back to Italy from Dubai, and found myself dead tired. I know I'm 8 chaps behind, and you don't have to worry. I will try to make up for them.</p><p>On another note, because time here is 3 hours behind Dubai, i might change the update time to 8pm Italian time since I barely have enough time in the morning due to my classes―which is the main thing that's taking up my time.</p><p>I apologize again, and will try to make it up asap.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-753.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-755.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

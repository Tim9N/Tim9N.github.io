        <p>It first started with the first cataclysm.</p><p>A shift in tectonic plates all over earth. Moving countries from where they previously were, and producing tsunamis and earthquakes in the process. By the end of the first cataclysm, the world map changed completely creating one supercontinent.</p><p>Many hypothesized that the first cataclysm occurred so the earth could acclimate to the mana that would soon enter the planet.</p><p>It made sense, and I also believed it was the case.</p><p>I was wrong.</p><p>"So you're telling me the first cataclysm wasn't something that occurred naturally but was instead done by this so called Protector?"</p><p>"The First Cataclysm, as the world named it as such, was the day that the Protector blessed this world with his presence." The nun looked at the statue with reverence. "His mere presence brought change to this world."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>The more she spoke, the more confused I become. Despite that, I somewhat understood some of her words.</p><p>'Is she implying that the first cataclysm happened because he came to this world?'</p><p>…How powerful was that?</p><p>"Mana was a gift that the Protector bestowed upon us from the goodness of their heart." The nun paused, looking at me with a clear smile. "Since they bestowed upon us this power, it is only fitting that the Protect decides who should keep the power and who shan't. Am I right?"</p><p>'I think I've heard enough.'</p><p>What she said… It was enough to make me understand what was going on.</p><p>"Why did the protector 'bless' us with mana?"</p><p>If they were too afraid of us getting too much power, why even give us the power in the first place?</p><p>It made no sense.</p><p>"The motives of the Protector aren't things that the likes of us can understand."</p><p>The nun replied.</p><p>"We must appreciate what they have already blessed us with."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>I found myself tearing my gaze away from her and focusing it on the statue.</p><p>'Is this what you were trying to show me, Kevin? This so called Protector?'</p><p>While I wasn't sure about the specifics behind this so called 'blessing', I knew for a fact that it had something to do with the records.</p><p>The clues were there. The Laws in Octavious's body, Matthew's words, the Nun's words… Everything linked to the Records.</p><p>Whoever this protector was… they were most likely with the Records, perhaps even their creation.</p><p>"This Protector of yours…"</p><p>I looked at the nun. There was something else I was curious about.</p><p>"…Do they have a name?"</p><p>Protector of the seat of Diligence. That was more of a title than a name.</p><p>'I'm sure, whoever this Protector is, they must have a name, right? ... Or do they just go by titles?'</p><p>"Name?"</p><p>The nurse looked at me incredulously.</p><p>"How would the likes of me know? The true name of the Protector is not something we can know. Only Protectors can know the name of other Protectors."</p><p>"There are others?"</p><p>This… how should I say… I somewhat expected it.</p><p>'It looks like my earlier hunch wasn't wrong.'</p><p>Perhaps the term 'Diligence' was truly the same Diligence as the one in the seven virtues.</p><p>'Wouldn't this mean there are six other of these so called Protectors around?'</p><p>I found myself frowning at the thought. One was already scary enough… six more? I could only shudder at the thought.</p><p>Creak―!</p><p>The wooden door of the chapel creaked, and I broke free from my thoughts. When I raised my head, my eyes paused on a certain figure.</p><p>'He looks familiar.'</p><p>That was the first thing I thought when my gaze paused on him.</p><p>It was so dimly lit that I was unable to get a good look at who had just entered, but the moment I laid my eyes on them, I felt a sense of familiarity.</p><p>"Ah, if it isn't our most esteemed benefactor."</p><p>I was surprised by the nun's words as I turned to see her rushing toward the man who had just entered the chapel.</p><p>Following her back, I heard a certain voice, and my breath stopped.</p><p>"Sister Viviana. It's nice to see you again."</p><p>"If it isn't little Oliver. It's so nice that you visit us despite being so busy."</p><p>"It's what I must do."</p><p>"Are these gifts for us?"</p><p>"It's just a little something I picked up while coming here. Don't mind it too much."</p><p>"Why aren't you kind, Oliver."</p><p>'Oliver? Waylan?'</p><p>I now understood why I felt that he looked familiar. Upon casting a closer look at him, the man that stood before the nun was indeed Waylan. He looked exactly the same as I remembered… uncannily so.</p><p>"Oh, how rare. It looks like you have visitors today."</p><p>Finally taking notice of me, Oliver smiled and waved his hand at me. I smiled back and waved at him.</p><p>"It's nice to meet you."</p><p>"What have you come into this rundown place for?"</p><p>He walked up to me while looking around the chapel.</p><p>"It isn't often that I come to visit, but it's usually just me and sister Viviana. I've never seen anyone else here… You can say it's a breath of fresh air."</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>The way he carried himself and his speech was the same as the Waylan that I knew.</p><p>"Mhm. I've been coming here for the past two decades, and you're the first person I've seen come into this orphanage."</p><p>"Past two decades?"</p><p>I looked at Waylan in surprise.</p><p>'He's been coming here for the past decade?'</p><p>"Oh, yes. He's such a lovely young man. Each time he comes, he always brings gifts for us and the children."</p><p>The nun―sister Viviana―patted Waylan on the shoulder.</p><p>"We would've been in quite a lot of trouble if it weren't for him. I must say, he really is a sweetheart."</p><p>"You flatter me too much."</p><p>Waylan scratched the back of his head in embarrassment.</p><p>I pursed my lips at the sight. There was something unsettling about the current situation, but I couldn't tell what it was.</p><p>The more I observed Waylan, the more I felt that there was nothing wrong with him. He was indeed 'normal', in the sense that his body did not contain Akashic Laws… but the very fact that he was here was alarming.</p><p>"If I may ask…"</p><p>I scratched the side of my neck while keeping my eyes focused on Waylan.</p><p>"…What is the reason you're here? How did you find this orphanage?"</p><p>"That's a question I'd like to ask you, instead."</p><p>Waylan smiled as he put the gifts he brought toward the nearby bench.</p><p>"This isn't a very well known orphanage. There are many out there, and I'm surprised you managed to find this one."</p><p>"Technology advances quite fast."</p><p> I chuckled a little.</p><p>"It wasn't really that hard to find. Plus, you can say that I came here for a purpose."</p><p>"He came for the Protector."</p><p>Sister Viviana suddenly said, happily taking the gifts that were resting on the bench.</p><p>"The Protector?"</p><p>Waylan looked at me strangely before looking toward the statue behind me.</p><p>"Don't tell me you actually believe the story behind the Protector?"</p><p>"Hm, who knows." I smiled at Waylan. "It's a fascinating story, I'll give her that."</p><p>"It indeed is."</p><p>Waylan smiled and tidied his clothes. He then checked his watch.</p><p>"Oh, it looks like my time is up. I have to leave now. My daughter will nag me if I'm late today. She seems adamant about making sure I came home today. Something about helping a friend of hers."</p><p>"You're leaving already?"</p><p>Sister Viviana looked rather saddened by that fact, but that was as far as it went. She didn't try to convince him to stay.</p><p>"Mhm. You know how Emma can be when she's angry… "</p><p>"That's true."</p><p>Sister Viviana giggled.</p><p>"Say hi to her for me."</p><p>"Will do."</p><p>He proceeded to put on a light brown coat before turning his attention toward me.</p><p>"Well, it was nice meeting you young man. I hope you enjoy your stay here."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>I smiled and waved at him. After that, I watched him peacefully leave the orphanage.</p><p>"What a poor man."</p><p>Just then, I heard Sister Viviana's voice. I turned to look at her.</p><p>"Poor man?"</p><p>What was she trying to imply?</p><p>"Uhm, if you would mind."</p><p>She passed me some of the gifts and I took them. After that, I followed her into the deeper ends of the chambers.</p><p>"Oliver… That child… Do you know why he always comes here?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>I shook my head. I was honestly clueless in that regard.</p><p>Sister Viviana stopped in front of a wooden door and opened it to reveal a small room. Walking in, she set some of the gifts down.</p><p>"Uh… I'm getting quite old for this."</p><p>She stretched her back with both hands on her sides. At the same time, she looked at the room with a gentle smile.</p><p>"This Orphanage once was quite popular. It wasn't as run down as it is now, and it was all thanks to Juliana…"</p><p>While listening to her words, I set the gifts down.</p><p>"Juliana?"</p><p>"His wife."</p><p>My brows jumped a little.</p><p>"His wife used to work here?"</p><p>"Indeed."</p><p>Sister Viviana nodded her head.</p><p>"You can say that she's the only reason he's still been coming here after all these years… A pity that Emma doesn't want to come here, I quite miss the little girl."</p><p>"Right."</p><p>I could more or less understand why Emma refused to come here. Given her character, she probably didn't want to be reminded of her mother every time that she came here.</p><p>I knew her well enough to tell this much…</p><p>"It really is a pity… She was such a lovely girl. She looked so much like Juliana…"</p><p>There was clear regret on Sister Viviana's face as she said those words. It became clear to me that she was close to Emma's mother.</p><p>I looked around the place.</p><p>"I think it's about time I leave. I'm satisfied with what I've learned."</p><p>"Ah, is that so. That's a pity."</p><p>Sister Viviana reluctantly said, placing her hand over her cheek.</p><p>"…I wanted to show you the children."</p><p>"Maybe next time."</p><p>I smiled at her.</p><p>"Next time it is."</p><p>She opened the door for me and we both went out.</p><p>"Young man, just a reminder before you leave."</p><p>Hearing her voice, I turned to her.</p><p>"Don't let yourself be led astray. Choose the right side."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-748.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-750.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

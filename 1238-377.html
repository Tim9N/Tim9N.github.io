        <p>Rumble—</p><p>With a low rumble, the ground shook and the doors of Henlour opened up.</p><p>Without saying anything, we entered the gates.</p><p>"Welcome back."</p><p>Greeting us at the entrance of the city was another dwarf. By now, most people already knew who we were, and hence, whenever they saw us, they would greet us.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Greeting them back, we once again entered the city.</p><p>Rumble—</p><p>It wasn't long before a low rumble sounded again and the gates closed shut behind us.</p><p>"Go get some proper rest. We will start our preparations for the elven domain over the next few days."</p><p>"Got it."</p><p>The first thing we did was go back to our own residences to get changed.</p><p>Having stayed in the nearby forests for over a month, everyone needed to get a proper bath.</p><p>Although our tents were indeed advanced, they still didn't have showers built in them. As such, whenever someone needed to wash, they would need to go to a nearby river to get cleaned.</p><p>Actually, I did briefly pass by Henlour a week ago to talk to Malvil about my sword, so it was only a week for me.</p><p>"Huam."</p><p>Once I arrived at my residence and separated myself from the others, I headed for the shower.</p><p>Turning the valve on, I let the warm water fall on my tired body, which had a couple of scars on them, before i relaxed completely.</p><p>Once I was done with the shower, drying my hair with a clean towel, I sat on the bed.</p><p>As I sat down, the water droplets that dropped down from my body traced down my toned body before they reached the clean bedsheets, wetting them.</p><p>"Let's see if anyone contacted me during all this time."</p><p>Opening my desk drawer, I took out my watch and booted it on.</p><p>Since there was no signal outside of the city as the dwarves tried to limit most outside communications, I had no idea about what had happened while I was gone.</p><p>It wasn't even a moment before a long string of text appeared on my watch. All of them coming from the same individual.</p><p>"Oh, Malvil called me."</p><p>'Is he finished with the sword?'</p><p>Him calling me only meant one thing: the sword was almost ready.</p><p>After the incident with Inferno, and after spending nine months improving my swordsmanship, I was finally able to convince him into forging a sword for me.</p><p>Not many had such a privilege, and so I was very happy with this development.</p><p>"That aside, I also feel much better now that I no longer have the tracking device inside of my head working."</p><p>Thanks to Jomnuk's coaching, Ryan was able to develop to the point where he could now easily hack into my chip and tamper with the device.</p><p>He could turn it on and off whenever he wanted to. This was a great piece of news to me as I could definitely make do with it in the future.</p><p>Especially at the conference where I was going to meet up with the Union.</p><p>With the chip tracking device off, they would of course be unable to tell that I was 876, but for sure I was going to let them understand that they had messed with someone extremely petty.</p><p>Well, that was granted if the opportunity for it came. If there wasn't, I could just wait for later.</p><p>'Right, that fucker will also be there…'</p><p>Recalling a certain face inside of my memories, my lips tugged upwards.</p><p>'I've still got quite the score to settle with you, don't I?'</p><p>If there was someone whom I hated much more than the Union, it would be none other than the individual that brought me to 'that place' to begin with.</p><p>'The pain I had suffered there…'</p><p>The sound of my teeth grinding together sounded across the room.</p><p>"Huuuu."</p><p>I took a deep breath, trying to calm down.</p><p>There was a time for everything and now was not that time.</p><p>Standing up and quickly getting changed, I headed for the door of my room.</p><p>Cli- Clank—</p><p>Right now, my priority should be visiting Malvil and seeing how much he progressed on my sword.</p><p>I wanted to leave for the elven domain with a new sword, especially since the ones I have been using weren't the right fit for me. They just broke too readily.</p><p>***</p><p>If there was one thing that I hated about the fourth level, it would without a doubt be the tremendous heat.</p><p>With it being so close to the earth's core, it was extremely hot.</p><p>Every time I went there, it would feel as though I was inside a steaming hot sauna.</p><p>It wasn't pleasant, to say the least.</p><p>"You're finally here, human!"</p><p>Upon entering the main building of the facility center, Malvil came to greet me at the door.</p><p>Well, it was more like he was already there talking to the secretary, and only greeted me once he saw me coming in.</p><p>"Took you long enough... I was already done a couple of days ago." He grumbled, looking at me with a peeved expression.</p><p>"That fast?"</p><p>He sounded quite annoyed, but I merely shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>Couldn't be blamed, I put all of my focus on training instead of anything else. Though, I was impressed by his speed.</p><p>"Follow me."</p><p>Bidding goodbye to the secretary, Malvil brought me to his workroom.</p><p>Just like in the previous times that I had been there, it was a mess. With equipment sprawled all over the place and scrap pieces of metal on the floor, it looked as though a storm had raged inside of the room.</p><p>Fortunately, I was already used to this. Stepping over the garbage, we soon paused in front of a large desk.</p><p>Thump—</p><p>Dropping a long object that was covered in a thin white cloth onto the table, producing a dull sound, Malvil slowly unfolded the sword.</p><p>The moment he unfurled the cloth and my eyes paused on the sword, my face twitched slightly.</p><p>"…Is this the completed sword?"</p><p>It took me a while to process the…sword in front of me, if it could even be called that.</p><p>It looked nothing like it. Rather, it looked more like a burned stick.</p><p>With no sharp edges, no grip, and completely nothing that would make it look like a sword, the thing that was in front of me could not even be considered one.</p><p>'Don't tell me that he failed?'</p><p>But that was impossible. With Malvil's pride, he would never show me something like this unless there was something more to it.</p><p>As my thoughts paused there, I looked up to Malvil who was looking at the sword with traces of satisfaction on his face.</p><p>Extending his finger forward and tracing it over the body of the piece of metal, Malvil muttered to himself.</p><p>"How beautiful…"</p><p>'Really? You call that thing beautiful?'</p><p>I really wanted to say those words out loud but I managed to keep my mouth shut throughout the whole time.</p><p>It was only after a couple of minutes passed that Malvil finally regained himself and coughed slightly.</p><p>"Keum…sorry about that, almost lost myself there."</p><p>"…Right," I replied with a forceful smile.</p><p>"Oy, what's with that look?"</p><p>But it appeared that my face was quite obvious as Malvil glared at me.</p><p>Raising my hands in a show of peace, I calmly replied, "Nothing. I was just curious if this was the sword that you were planning on forging for me."</p><p>"Of course it is."</p><p>Malvil slammed his small hand on the table.</p><p>He then pointed towards the long piece of metal.</p><p>"Can't you see that this is the frame of the sword?"</p><p>"Well yes, I could tell that much."</p><p>"Sigh, ignorance is such a bliss."</p><p>Shaking his head, Malvil interlocked his hands behind his back before walking towards another counter and picking up a small white hammer that was adorned with tiny blue, red, and green crystals.</p><p>He then proceeded to walk towards the sword frame.</p><p>Throwing me one last glare, he handed me the hammer.</p><p>"Here, you'll understand once you do it."</p><p>"You're giving that to me?" I asked, confusion dying my face. Why in the world was he giving me the hammer?</p><p>"Just take it."</p><p>Obviously annoyed by my question, Malvil shoved the hammer in my hands and pointed at the sword frame.</p><p>"Now hammer the sword!"</p><p>Seeing just how serious he was being, I calmed myself down quickly and stared at the sword frame.</p><p>I knew that Malvil was not someone who would joke about things related to his profession, so without wasting any more time, raising my hand which held onto the hammer, I prepared to hit the sword with it.</p><p>"Inject your mana before you do it."</p><p>But before I could even swing downwards, Malvil's voice traveled through my ears.</p><p>"Got it."</p><p>Closing my eyes, I channeled all of my mana into the hammer.</p><p>Vooom—!</p><p>The gems embedded on the hammer's side suddenly started to glow, lighting up the room in beautiful myriad colors.</p><p>Once that happened, pointing towards the metal frame, Malvil shouted, "Now! Hammer the sword right now!"</p><p>Snapping out of it and nodding in response, I swung my hand downwards.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>A loud metallic ring swept throughout the room as the hammer in my hand came into contact with the sword frame.</p><p>"Again!"</p><p> Malvil shouted after the ringing in the air dissipated.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>Without saying anything, raising my hand once again, I swung the hammer and a similar ring swept through the room.</p><p>Once the ringing sounded disappeared, Malvil once again shouted.</p><p>"Again!"</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>Raising my hand again, I once again swung.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>"Again!"</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>"Again!"</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>And so for the next three hours, the same scene repeated again and again as I continued to hammer the metal.</p><p>TWIIIING—!</p><p>Smashing the hammer one more time, another loud ring rang out and a bright light suddenly enveloped the room.</p><p>"Move back."</p><p>As soon as the light appeared, pushing me back, Malvil snatched the hammer from my hands and once again hammered the sword frame.</p><p>Clank—! Clank—!</p><p>With each swing, his arm became faster and faster, and before long, the bright light that came from the sword enveloped the entire room, blinding me completely.</p><p>"Give me your arm."</p><p>He shouted before I felt a small hand grasp my wrist and bring me forward.</p><p>I was completely blinded by this point, so I had no idea what he was trying to do, but it was at that moment that I felt a sharp sting coming from the tip of my finger and a strange worm-like feeling suddenly enveloped my body.</p><p>It felt like I was being constricted, or stung by a viper. I couldn't be sure, because my senses were going haywire.</p><p>But that feeling didn't last for long as all the remaining mana inside of my body suddenly got sucked out of me, and headed like a torrent towards the sword, to the point where I felt the pain.</p><p>"Ughk!"</p><p>"Resist the pain! We're almost done!"</p><p>Malvil shouted from the side as my knees buckled up slightly.</p><p>"Ukh!"</p><p>Letting out another groan, one of my knees gave out and I fell to the ground, but thankfully, supporting me from the side was Malvil, as his big, burly hands pushed me up from below.</p><p>"I…I can't last much longer," I weakly muttered, trying my best to remain awake. Every second that passed felt agonizing, and slowly but surely I was feeling all the energy in my body getting sucked out of me.</p><p>"Done!"</p><p>TWIIIIIINNG!!!</p><p>Thankfully, right before I passed out, Malvil removed my hand, and another crisp ring rang out throughout the room.</p><p>"Haaa….haaa…."</p><p>Falling down on the ground, I tried to catch my breath as sweat dripped down from the side of my face.</p><p>'What kind of demonic rite was that? You making a sword or what?!' I screamed inwardly. Unfortunately, I couldn't speak, and exhaustion had overtaken me.</p><p>Before long, once I managed to rest for a good minute, I finally opened my eyes.</p><p>"What do you say?"</p><p>It was then that I saw it.</p><p>My new sword.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-376.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-378.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

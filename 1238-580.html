        <p>"Congratulations Brian."</p><p>There was a festive mood enveloping a small bar as two figures sat on stools and enjoyed their beers. There was an obvious contrast between the two figures: one was lanky and youthful, while the other was extremely handsome and more mature looking.</p><p>Nevertheless, the two seemed to be on good terms with each other.</p><p>The figures were Brian and Hemlock, his superior.</p><p>"You handled the situation skillfully and obtained connections despite not having any special powers. I can tell that you put a lot of effort into the negotiations."</p><p>"Thanks…Hicc…"</p><p>Brian thanked Hemlock as his face flushed. He was clearly drunk at the moment.</p><p>"Not a heavy drinker, eh?"</p><p> Taking a sip of the beer, Hemlock wiped the foam that had accumulated on the top of his lips. His actions instantly attracted the gaze of all the people around them.</p><p>Not minding the attention one bit, Hemlock put the beer down.</p><p>"Although we have done a good job today, we still have a lot to do. Don't get too complacent."</p><p>As a good supervisor, it was within his duty to remind Brian that he shouldn't let success get to his head.</p><p>"…Yeah."</p><p>Brain weekly nodded his head as he heard Hamlock's words. He was currently extremely intoxicated, and whether he had truly understood his words or not, Hemlock wasn't sure.</p><p>Nonetheless, Hemlock smiled.</p><p>"It really is a pity that someone as capable as you has such poor talent."</p><p>There was genuine pity in his voice as he spoke those words.</p><p>In the past half-year, Hemlock noticed a dramatic increase in his work efficiency; he could now find all the information he needed within a few seconds of asking Brian. He was that amazing.</p><p>Brian was thorough and especially fast. This was what made Hemlock like him so much.</p><p>If only he had been born with more talent...</p><p>"…a real pity."</p><p>While bringing the drink down, he stared through the bar's glass window at the city streets through which he could see white and red lights drift across the streets.</p><p>"How beautiful."</p><p>Hemlock mumbled silently.</p><p>His complexion changed as he clutched the drink in his hand. His brows furrowed tightly.</p><p>"…but it's truly a pity that this won't last for long."</p><p>"What do you mean?"</p><p>Brian asked as he overheard Hemlock's words.</p><p>Hemlock shook his head as he stared at Smallsnake who was trying his best to keep himself from passing out.</p><p>"Why do you think that it won't last?"</p><p>"Haaa…"</p><p>Exhaling, Hemlock raised his beer and took a sip.</p><p>Smacking his lips together, he asked.</p><p>"What is the rank of the strongest human at the moment?"</p><p>"&lt;SS+&gt; rank."</p><p>Brian answered.</p><p>Hemlock nodded his head in response.</p><p>"That's right. The current strongest human in the human domain is &lt;SS+&gt; rank…"</p><p>Hemlock lowered his hand and placed the beer on the counter.</p><p>"Do you know just how strong the Demon King is? Or the most powerful people outside of humanity are?"</p><p>"…Not sure."</p><p>Brian answered.</p><p>"Maybe around &lt;SSS-&gt; rank? We've caught up quite a lot with them."</p><p>"Heee…"</p><p>Hemlock scoffed out loud as he shook his head.</p><p>"If you really think that, then that's naive of you."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"...You might not know it since your education isn't the best and you're still quite young, but the Demon King sees *SSSS-&gt; rank as nothing in his eyes. They are merely bugs he can squish with a snap of his fingers."</p><p>"Is that so?…Hicc!"</p><p>Brian's body jumped up and he hiccuped out loud.</p><p>Waving the drink in his hand, he almost fell off his chair.</p><p>"Watch out."</p><p>"Wahh!"</p><p>Hemlock extended his hand and blocked Smallsnake's chair.</p><p>"You've got to be more careful."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Sobering up a little, Brian thanked Hemlock.</p><p>Hemlock's timely assistance prevented him from falling to the ground.</p><p>"No problem."</p><p>Hemlock downed his drink and wiped his lips.</p><p>"Refreshing."</p><p>He let out a satisfied sound.</p><p>Placing the drink back on the countertop he stood up from his stool.</p><p>"Alright, let's get going now."</p><p>"Wait, I'm not done."</p><p>Brian waved his drink which was still only half full.</p><p>Hemlock's looked at Brian with a strange look.</p><p>"You're going to pass out if you finish that drink."</p><p>"I'll be fine…hicc!"</p><p>Taking another sip of the drink, Brian switched the conversation.</p><p>"Back to what you were saying about the Demon King treating &lt;SSS-&gt; ranks as if they are nothing, doesn't that mean that we're basically screwed?"</p><p>Hemlock's complexion shifted as he heard Brian's words.</p><p>He quickly sat down back on the stool.</p><p>"…Do you think otherwise?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>Brian shook his head repeatedly.</p><p>"If it's exactly as you've said, then we truly are screwed. I don't know when the demon king will arrive back on earth, but if we continue progressing at this pace, then humanity will face inevitable extinction soon. Heck, it would even be better to join the demons. At least, this way we can stop humanity from going extinct."</p><p>"Yes, yes."</p><p>Hemlock's face brightened as he nodded his head.</p><p>"You also think so, right?"</p><p>"Well, yes."</p><p>Brian looked at Hemlock with a face that said 'isn't it obvious?'</p><p>"Haha."</p><p>Hemlock laughed a little as his shoulders relaxed and he whispered softly.</p><p>"I see that you also agree with me on this matter. Mayb—"</p><p>Thump—!</p><p>Just as Hemlock was about to finish his sentence, he heard a loud thump and it was then that he spotted Brian's head slumped over the table counter, completely passed out.</p><p>"I knew it."</p><p>With a shake of his head, Hemlock took out his wallet and placed a couple of bills on the counter. Then, grabbing Brian by the shoulder, he brought him out of the bar.</p><p>As he walked toward the exit of the bar, he turned his head to glance at Brian.</p><p>Opening his mouth, he silently mumbled.</p><p>"Maybe…just maybe…you will understand what I'm trying to do."</p><p>***</p><p>Drip—! Drip—!</p><p>Opening his eyes, Smallsnake woke up to a familiar sight and sound. Darkness and the dripping sound coming from the corner of the room.</p><p>"Haaa…haaa…"</p><p>Breathing in and out, Smallsnake felt extremely weak. Raising his hand to touch his forehead, he realized that it was boiling hot.</p><p>'Shit, I've got a fever.'</p><p>This familiar sensation that he had been feeling since childhood, without a doubt he had had a fever.</p><p>Wiping the sweat from the side of his face, Smallsnake carefully sat up straight.</p><p>"Haaa…haaa…"</p><p>As he heavily gulped for air, Smallsnake found the world around him spinning as he felt lightheaded.</p><p>"T..this is bad."</p><p>Not only was the world around him spinning, but his heart was also beating faster as he could hear it reverberate throughout the silent room.</p><p>Ba…thump! Ba…thump!</p><p>'Make it stop.'</p><p>It was honestly driving him crazy as he hunched over his knees and covered his head with his hands.</p><p>Soon his body began to shake and sweat dripped down his face all the way to the ground.</p><p>"I…it hurts."</p><p>While his teeth chattered, Smallsnake hugged his body even more tightly as the pain in his body increased.</p><p>Time flew by, and Smallsnake's condition started to worsen and his eyes started to become more and more hallow. As he gradually let go of his knees, he could no longer feel any energy inside of his body.</p><p>'Help. Someone help me.'</p><p>He couldn't even speak.</p><p>Krrr…krrrr…</p><p>Just then, in the midst of his despair, Smallsnake heard the sound of the doors opening, and bright light spilled through the narrow gaps.</p><p>The moment the light spilled in, Smallsnake instinctively closed his eyes.</p><p>'It hurts.'</p><p>He thought as dread started to encapsulate him. He knew that he couldn't work in the conditions that he was in, and he would only be a burden to Ren.</p><p>Once his thought paused there, Smallsnake had a sudden thought.</p><p>'Should I just give up?'</p><p>He was useless. Ever since coming here, Smallsnake had been unable to help Ren at all. It was then that he came to a realization, and that was that he was only dragging Ren and the others down.</p><p>His weak talent was holding the others down.</p><p>'…I knew it. I should just give up.'</p><p>Slowly the light that was spilling from the narrow gaps of the door started to dim as a soft smile spread across Smallsnake's face.</p><p>It was at that moment that Smallsnake could tell that he was close to dying.</p><p>Rather than being sad about it, he felt relieved.</p><p>'Maybe this is for the best.'</p><p>His death would allow Ren and the others to have an easier time for when they would escape. If that was the case, then Smallsnake felt no regrets.</p><p>…or rather, there was one, but he knew that it was now no longer possible for him to fulfill it.</p><p>"Haaa…"</p><p>Letting out a small sound, darkness slowly invaded Smallsnake's sight.</p><p>"Smallsnake!" "Smallsnake!" "Smallsnake!"</p><p>Just as the darkness was about to completely swallow his consciousness whole, Smallsnake heard a couple of familiar voices call out for him.</p><p>There was Ren, Angelica, Hein, Leopold, and Ryan…</p><p>'Ah, I hope they will be fine without me looking after them.'</p><p>Those wore his last thoughts before his conciseness slipped and darkness enveloped his vision.</p><p>"Smallsnake!!!!!"</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-579.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-581.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

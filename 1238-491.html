        <p>'That was a lot more painful than I thought.'</p><p>Leaning by the wall of the room, I heavily gasped for air.</p><p>"Haa...haaa.."</p><p>My arm still hurt, but with the aid of the potion that Amanda had given me, I was slowly starting to feel better.</p><p>That being said.</p><p>"I don't think I can use the fifth movement at its full potential just yet..."</p><p>Injuries aside, it became apparent to me that there was still a small way to go for me before being able to use the fifth movement comfortably.</p><p>My body could still not withstand the full power of the attack.</p><p>If I had to make an estimate, then by the time I reached &lt;S-&gt; rank, I would have no problem executing it.</p><p>Wait.</p><p>Raising my head, my eyes lit up.</p><p>"There is actually a way..."</p><p>A way for me to use the fifth movement without breaking my body apart.</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>Propping my body up with the aid of my arm, Amanda suddenly called out for me. She had a complicated look on her face as she stared at the scar in the distance.</p><p>"Ren."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"Did you do this?"</p><p>"...Ah."</p><p>Staring into the distance, I finally noticed the long scar tracing across the wall. Not only that, but I was also able to see Jin.</p><p>Scratching the back of my head, a wry smile appeared on my face.</p><p>"How are you doing Jin? Been a while since I've seen you."</p><p>Let's just pretend that nothing happened.</p><p>"..."</p><p>With his back turned against me, Jin continued to trace his finger across the scar on the wall. He then eventually turned his head and met my eyes.</p><p>"How were you able to do this?"</p><p>"Well..."</p><p>Pursing my lips, and feeling everyone's eyes land on me, I knew that there was no point in feining ignorance. Thus, I just came clean.</p><p>"I was just practicing a technique of mine. Didn't think it would end up doing this much damage..."</p><p>Actually, I didn't think I would've even have able to pull the move on the first attempt. Even though it wasn't exactly complete, it was still the fifth movement.</p><p>Gazing at Amanda from the corner of my eyes, and turning my head to look at the scar again, I apologized.</p><p>"Sorry about the scar. If you want me to pa—"</p><p>"It's fine."</p><p>Amanda sighed.</p><p>"Next time choose a more appropriate room."</p><p>'Do you think I actually knew this was going to happen?'</p><p>No way in hell would I have expected the fifth movement to be so strong.</p><p>"...Alright. I will do so."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Amanda softly nodded her head.</p><p>Then suddenly, Amanda's smartwatch vibrated. It was a message. Amanda glanced at her smartwatch, then looked back at the female assistant.</p><p>"Let the other know that the situation is resolved. There is no attack. It was just an incident."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>The assistant's back straightened. She quickly rushed out of the room.</p><p>Staring at the assistant leaving the room, it finally dawned on me. What was Jin doing here? He wasn't the type of person that would go out of his way to meet Amanda unless it was something important.</p><p>"Mind if I ask, but what is Jin doing here?"</p><p>"Jin?"</p><p>Amanda glanced at Jin, and their eyes met. He gave her a short nod.</p><p>Pursing her lips, Amanda started to explain.</p><p>"He's here about a possible collaboration. Because of the crack in the sky, we're both currently short on staff."</p><p>"Collaboration?"</p><p>"Yes, we're trying to get rid of a supply station," Jin suddenly cut in. "You weren't here when this was happening, but recently, a new pill has started to spread throughout the human domain. We've currently found one of its bigger supply stations, and we're trying to get rid of it."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>'Right, there was something about this in my memories.'</p><p>A lot of the future events may have changed, however, there were still some things that didn't change. For example this event.</p><p>It was an event that was supposed to happen in the 'novel', and it was an event where Jin and Amanda would suffer tremendous losses to their forces.</p><p>Not sure how that worked anymore.</p><p>Regardless, I decided to say my piece.</p><p>"If you two are talking about the supply station, in the northern district, Morfill street, then I suggest the two of you not to go."</p><p>Amanda and Jin looked at each other.</p><p>"If I'm not wrong, then the supply station you two are going to is a trap devised by the other guilds to bring you down."</p><p>Because the gap between the top two guilds and the other ones was widening, in order to reduce their influence and force, the other diamond-graded guilds decided to resort to dirty tactics in order to reduce their influence.</p><p>As such, they devised a trap to damanage a small elite force of both respective guilds.</p><p>There was a chance of me being wrong with all the events changing, but it was never wrong to be on the safe side.</p><p>"If I'm not wrong, the two of you will probably go with only a couple of &lt;S&gt; rankers and expect to bulldoze your way toward the supply station, right?"</p><p>Upon saying those words, the faces of Amanda and Jin changed. I felt a boost in confidence when I saw this. It really does seem like this is the event.</p><p>"Actually, if you're wondering how valid my words are, even I'm not too sure. However, it's best if you two become more alert during the mission. Who knows, things might truly end up as I said, and the both of you will suffer tremendous losses. I'm sure neither of you would want that."</p><p>There was a brief moment of silence after I said those words.</p><p>Breaking the silence, Amanda turned to look at Jin.</p><p>"What do you think?"</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>Lifting his head up to glance my way, Jin took a deep breath.</p><p>"How sure are you about this?"</p><p>"Fifty percent? Maybe less?"</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Jin nodded his head. He then turned to look at Amanda.</p><p>"If it's as Ren said, this can also be a good opportunity for the both of us."</p><p>"I agree."</p><p>Amanda replied in agreement. Placing his hand under his chin, Jin thought of something.</p><p>"Let's secretly bring more &lt;S&gt; rankers with us. If there truly is a trap, we can take this chance to find out who is against us and deal a blow against them."</p><p>"How many &lt;S&gt; rankers can Starlight guild bring?"</p><p>"...If we exclude my father and grandfather, I can bring an extra two."</p><p>"Demon Hunter can also do the same."</p><p>"I'll take my leave now."</p><p>Seeing that there was nothing else for me to say, I tactfully decided to leave. As much as I wanted to go with them, there were other things I needed to do.</p><p>"Huh, ah yes. Don't worry about the wall."</p><p>Amanda bid me goodbye. Jin did the same as he nodded his head, and I nodded back before leaving the room.</p><p>Clank—!</p><p>"That's on problem sorted."</p><p>With Amanda and Jin possibly avoiding a terrible scenario, my mind felt at ease.</p><p>That being said.</p><p>Coming to a halt in the middle of the hall, I realized something.</p><p>'Perhaps not everything has changed.'</p><p>Recently, I had been using my memories of the future less and less. The reason for this was because I no longer trusted them as much, and because of all the changes that I did.</p><p>However, if I looked back at it now, not all had changed.</p><p>'If that's the case, I should use this chance to study my notes of the future once again and get rid of any potential trouble before they come.'</p><p>This was a feasible idea.</p><p>Rather than just waiting for bad stuff to happen, it was better if I got rid of them before they happened.</p><p>Putting my mask back on my face, I continued walking.</p><p>"I better get to work."</p><p>***</p><p>A couple of days passed by in the blink of an eye, and it was now Saturday.</p><p>"This should be the place."</p><p>Stopping in front of a coffee shop, I entered the place, and a nice aromatic coffee smell invaded my nostrils.</p><p>Glancing around the place, I soon spotted a familiar figure sitting in the corner of the shop.</p><p>"Been a while, Kevin."</p><p>Lifting his head up to stare in my direction, Kevin's eyes began to squint as his face darkened.</p><p>"Ren."</p><p>"Yes, that's my name."</p><p>I sat down comfortably on the chair opposite.</p><p>Leaning back on the chair, I noticed that there was an iced latte in front of me already. Did Kevin ordered it for me before hand? How sweet of him.</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>Thanking Kevin, I brought the latte to my lips and took a sip.</p><p>Feeling the refreshing taste of coffee in my mouth, I instantly felt a lot better.</p><p>"Nice..."</p><p>Putting the latter down I looked at Kevin.</p><p>"So, what did you want to talk about?"</p><p>I did find it odd that Kevin wanted to talk to me out of nowhere. At first, I thought it was because he was mad at me due to what I had said at the press conference, but looking at him now, it didn't seem like it.</p><p>"Haaa..."</p><p>Putting his own cup down, Kevin sighed.</p><p>Glancing around the place he waved his hand and erected an invisible sound barrier around us. Seeing his weird behavior, I became slightly alarmed. What exactly was he trying to do?</p><p>It was then that Kevin started to speak.</p><p>"Ren, I need your help."</p><p>"My help?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Kevin's face hardened a little. He seemed unsure about what to say. This aroused my curiosity.</p><p>"Spit it out. What do you need my help with."</p><p>"It's like this..."</p><p>Eventually, Kevin started to recount to me all the details regarding his mission. Since he had already told me all of his secrets, Kevin didn't shy away from telling me the stuff that he wouldn't normally say, like the the fact that the mission was from the system, and stuff.</p><p>Regarding the talk, it was about how he had to go to a different planet, to the rewards he would get from completing it, and the fact that he could bring three people to the mission.</p><p> By the time he was done speaking, I had already gotten a good grasp of what the mission entailed too. </p><p>"...And so since you already know about my secret, I didn't think twice about telling you. The only problem is that I'm still unsure about the third person."</p><p>"You don't have to worry about that."</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Taking a sip of the latte, I smiled slightly.</p><p>"I already have an idea on who to bring."</p><p>"You do?" Kevin curiously asked.</p><p>"Yeah," I nodded. "Given the details of the mission you told me, there is only one possible person that we can bring."</p><p>"Who?"</p><p>Lowering my hand. I stared at Kevin in the most obvious manner.</p><p>"Who else but Jin?"</p><p>"Jin?"</p><p>"Yeah, in the first place, we need someone to reach &lt;A-&gt; rank before even considering the mission. If we take that criterion into account, and the fact that Jin is very good with stealth, he's the best option we have for our mission."</p><p>There was also Angelica, however, in this mission, she would probably be the worst person to bring along.</p><p>Since demons could sense demonic energy a lot more easily than mana, if I brought Angelica with me, our location would potentially be exposed.</p><p>Furthermore, I actually needed Angelica to stay behind because I had something important for her to do.</p><p>So she was a no go. Leaving the most likely candidate to be Jin.</p><p>"Considering that you still have a bit of time to break through to &lt;A-&gt; rank, it's safe to say that we still have a bit of time before the trip, right?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Okay."</p><p>Chugging down the latte in my hand, I stood up.</p><p>"If that's the case, I will take my leave now. I need to sort some stuff out. Regarding the trip, count me in."</p><p>It would serve as a good experience.</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>Raising my hand, I bid Kevin goodbye. Since there was still time before the trip, it was best for me to get everything that I wanted to get done, done now.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-490.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-492.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

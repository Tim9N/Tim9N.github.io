        <p>Creak— Creak—</p><p>As footsteps rushed out, a creaking sound was heard coming from the wooden floor beneath.</p><p>A young teen clutching a small soup ran toward a bed in a rundown apartment as a sickly figure lay on it.</p><p>There were cracks on the walls, and there were spiderwebs on the corner of the house as dust filled the area. It was not a place where a child should be in.</p><p>"Have some soup mother."</p><p>Kneeling down, the youth's hand shook as he carefully placed the soup on the shelf beside the bed.</p><p>The youth was rather skinny and his complexion was rather pale, but his green eyes shone with ambition.</p><p>"M…mother."</p><p>Carefully touching the woman that was resting on the bed, the youth tried to wake her up.</p><p>The more he stared at her, the greater the pain and void in his heart became.</p><p>"B..Brian."</p><p>The woman finally awoke, revealing a pair of beautiful green eyes as she touched the youth's cheek.</p><p>As her sickly and skinny arm touched the youth's face, it barely remained there before falling weakly onto the bed.</p><p>Picking the arm back up, the youth placed it on his cheek.</p><p>A bright smile adorned his face.</p><p>"Mother, I've got good news for you."</p><p>A wave of excitement washed over the youth as he stared at his mother lying on the bed.</p><p>"I've finally got a job!"</p><p>The youth's voice raised as he thought of the job offer that he received not too long ago.</p><p>In a world that was primarily dominated by the strong, those that didn't have strength were not treated well.</p><p>Rather, they were considered to be the 'burden' of society as they contributed nothing to the crisis that enshrouded the world.</p><p>The youth who was staring at his mother was one of the unlucky few who was born without a talent.</p><p>Or rather, he had one, but it was only of the &lt;G&gt; rank level. Just like his mother.</p><p>Such talent was a curse in this world, as jobs were scarce. Who in their right minds would hire such talentless individuals?</p><p>People with great talents were the only ones able to land jobs since they were able to use their skills to complete tasks faster and more efficiently.</p><p>Farming? Why need farmers when you could have an awakened do the same tasks, faster and more efficiently?</p><p>Complex calculations? Just a simple skill and they would be able to do it faster and more efficiently.</p><p>A tough world greeted the mother and son duo, and they were just one of the many unfortunate ones.</p><p>That was until most recently.</p><p>"Listen here mom, I know that you're doubting me, but this job is clean. You can trust me!"</p><p>As he held tightly onto the sickly figure's hand, the youth thrust his face forward.</p><p>"…mom, the pay is really good and with it, I'll be able to finally pay for your medical bills! You will be healed"</p><p>Imagining his mother recovering and playing with him like in the good old days filled the youth with excitement.</p><p>"Mom, just watch me. I'll definitely cure you."</p><p>Feeling a clench of his hand, the youth looked toward his mother who looked back at him with a proud smile.</p><p>"I..believe you."</p><p>Her weak and frail voice echoed throughout the room.</p><p>Biting his lips, the youth squeezed her hand harder.</p><p>"Trust me."</p><p>***</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>Powerless, a figure lay on the floor groaning in a dark room.</p><p>"H..help."</p><p>He murmured quietly as he struggled to move. Currently, his body was paralyzed and he couldn't move a single muscle. He could only just barely feel his right foot, but that was just about it.</p><p>He felt trapped inside of his one Body.</p><p>'I'm thirsty, I'm hungry.'</p><p>To make matters worse, it had been quite a while since he had last drank or eaten something.</p><p>His mind was blurry and he was going in and out of consciousness.</p><p>'...If only I was born with more talent.'</p><p>The individual thought in the midst of his despair.</p><p>One thing was clear to him, despite his lack of understanding of what led to the sudden situation.</p><p>Had he been stronger, he would've never found himself in this situation.</p><p>This paralysis he was experiencing would've never happened if he was stronger or even a little bit more talented…</p><p>Never!</p><p>Drip—! Drip—!</p><p>The dripping sound from the corner of the room served no purpose as it only heightened the individual's paranoia and sense of thirst.</p><p>His eyes slowly grew bloodshot.</p><p>"Akh."</p><p>While biting his lips until they bled, the individual moved his body with all his strength.</p><p>"W..water."</p><p>He desperately needed water at the moment. Without it, he was a goner.</p><p>"Ukh."</p><p>As veins bulged on the side of his face, the figure slowly pushed his body with his foot. The only part of his body that he could feel.</p><p>"I …will definitely make it."</p><p>***</p><p>"Alright, I'm done packing. Let's head back to earth."</p><p>Melissa patted her hands in satisfaction as she headed toward Kevin.</p><p>Kevin shook his head and stared into the distance.</p><p>"We aren't leaving him yet."</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>Melissa tilted her head.</p><p>"Didn't you say before that it was your fault for bringing me here? You surely must know of a way to return?"</p><p>"I do."</p><p>Kevin replied while squinting his eyes and staring at the interface in front of him.</p><p>He was currently looking at Amanda.</p><p>'Amanda has been staying in the same spot for quite a while. Is she troubled with something? Or is she just resting?'</p><p>"Kevin?"</p><p>Startling Kevin out of his thought was Melissa's voice.</p><p>Turning his head, he was met with her annoyed face.</p><p>"Hm? What?"</p><p>"Did you not hear me?"</p><p>Taking a look at one of the plants in the distance, Melissa raised up her glasses.</p><p>"What are you thinking about? Are you telling me that there's no way back to earth?"</p><p>"Calm down for a second."</p><p>In an attempt to stop Melissa from talking, Kevin raised his hand and gazed in Amanda's general direction.</p><p>"There is a way to go back to earth. But there's a bit of a problem."</p><p>"I don't like the sound of this…"</p><p>Melissa's face hardened a little bit.</p><p>"Whenever I hear such words, I know there's incoming trouble."</p><p>Scratching the side of his check, Kevin meekly looked at Melissa before bitterly smiling.</p><p>'Right on.'</p><p>"It's not what you think Melissa. The problem isn't exactly big…"</p><p>"Not big?"</p><p>Melissa raised her brow.</p><p>Crossing her arms together she smiled.</p><p>"Please do tell me."</p><p>The smile she wore on the outside looked normal, but Kevin knew just how angry she was inside.</p><p>Her anger was understandable. For her to be suddenly dragged into a different planet out of nowhere...</p><p>Anyone else in her situation would react the way she did.</p><p>This was why Kevin didn't get angry or react.</p><p>Kevin struggled to find the right words to say as he gazed at Melissa. In the end, he came clean as he noticed Melissa's darkening expression.</p><p> "Basically, you weren't the only one dragged here. Amanda and the others have also been dragged here."</p><p>***</p><p>After the assault, three days passed, but nothing really changed.</p><p>Except for the fact that Jin and I weren't in opposite rooms anymore, the routine was pretty much the same.</p><p>Drink water, and bang the wall with my arms.</p><p>Wasn't exactly the most exciting routine, but it was better than doing nothing.</p><p>"Huuuu…"</p><p>As I sat cross-legged in the middle of the room, I took a deep breath and my chest heaved up and down rhythmically.</p><p>'I'm getting close.'</p><p>My arms were tingling, a sign that I was on the verge of reaching the next stage of my body art practice.</p><p>[Body Hardening]</p><p>Since I only used my arms and hands at the moment, those were the only areas that were hardening, but in any case, this was what I wanted since I could feel power surge from within me.</p><p>With enough practice, I could break down the wall with just one punch once I mastered the art.</p><p>It might take a while, but it was definitely possible.</p><p>…and that was all possible with my mana sealed.</p><p>"Huuuu…"</p><p>Taking another breath, I mumbled underneath my breath.</p><p>"Just a little bit more."</p><p>***</p><p>Crac..crack!</p><p>In a world where red dyed the skies, rotted vegetation, sparse water, and cracks tore the ground apart, a dark silhouette stepped into the middle of the void, tearing apart the space, and finally entered the planet.</p><p>Observing the planet from above, the figure fell slowly toward the ground.</p><p>"What a shit hole."</p><p>Landing on the ground, his presence spread throughout the planet and the ground beneath him trembled.</p><p>Immediately after, several demons rushed from a very far distance as the demon that had just arrived noted their approaching figures.</p><p>"Your royal highness, Magnus."</p><p>In front of the dark figure, the demons kneeled immediately. There were approximately two of them and both did not dare look up.</p><p>Briefly glancing at the demons, Magnus waved his hand.</p><p>"Rise up."</p><p>"Yes, your excellency."</p><p>Slowly, the demons rose to their feet. Standing up, they perspired from the sides of their faces as their backs remained straight.</p><p>Taking a look at the surroundings, Magnus monotonously asked.</p><p>"Have you seen any humans on this planet recently?"</p><p>"Humans?"</p><p>Suddenly faced with a question, the two demons turned to look at one another with confused looks.</p><p>Taking note of their reactions, Magnus immediately lost interest in them.</p><p>"…So you haven't."</p><p>"Eh, a—"</p><p>"Quiet."</p><p>Flicking his finger, the demon that was just about to speak disintegrated on the spot.</p><p>After that, the other demon's expression paled significantly as his back straightened further, and he stopped speaking altogether.</p><p>The fear in his eyes was evident as he looked at Magnus.</p><p>Meeting the demons' eyes, Magnus softly muttered.</p><p>"I don't like it when someone speaks when I don't give them permission to speak."</p><p>The demon immediately nodded his head.</p><p>With no regard for the other demon, Magnus sank into thought.</p><p>'This is the third planet where humans have not been found. While I don't know why his majesty is so fixated on a couple of humans, considering his personality, it must be about something extremely important.'</p><p>In Magnus's eyes, Jezebeth was like a god.</p><p>A figure that was beyond the realm of mortals, and was omnipotent.</p><p>Nothing could escape his eyes. And for him to pay this much attention to some humans, Magnus knew that he had to take this task extremely seriously.</p><p>'There's still a couple of planets missing. The closest one should be Illonia, while the closest one after that is Cassaria. I'll step into Illonia first before paying a visit to Cassaria. It shouldn't take too long."</p><p>Magnus nodded to himself as he planned his future course of action.</p><p>Taking a glance at the demon beside him, he waved dismissively.</p><p>"You have a good sense."</p><p>The space in front of him cracked immediately after he said those words.</p><p>Cra…crack!</p><p>Taking a step into the crack, his figure soon disappeared from the spot.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-568.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-570.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

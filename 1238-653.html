        <p>"Do me a favor and watch over the demons while I go back and rest for a bit."</p><p>I said as I gazed at the others who were staring at me with different expressions on their faces.</p><p>My vision was all messed up, and my mind was cloudy. It took everything I had in order to keep from passing out right there on the spot.</p><p>Even though I had taken several potions and my body was slowly healing, the actions I had taken in a few moments ago had used up what little energy I had left in my body, and I was now barely clinging to my consciousness by a thread.</p><p>The only reason why I was still hanging on was because I didn't want to show the demons any weakness.</p><p>Who knew what would happen if they saw me pass out on the spot?</p><p>"I got it."</p><p>Thankfully, the others were able to understand what I was trying to convey, and they all nodded their heads while maintaining a serious expressions.</p><p>I smiled in relief when I saw this.</p><p>"Great."</p><p>"Let me go with you."</p><p>Amanda offered me a helping hand as she walked next to me and opened the door that led to the insides of the castle.</p><p>"...Thank you."</p><p>I struggled to express my gratitude as my legs felt like lead and my vision wobbled.</p><p>'Not yet.'</p><p>I clenched my teeth and forcefully moved my legs tower the door.</p><p>On the surface, I sustained the solemn look that I had after defeating Suriol, but internally, I was experiencing excruciating pain that was radiating through every part of my body.</p><p>From the corner of my distorted vision, I could see Amanda biting her lips in concern as she observed my struggle. However, as if she understood my thoughts, she turned her head away and pretended to be unaware of my struggle.</p><p>I was thankful for that and mustering every little bit of my willpower I finally walked into the castle.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>It wasn't until I heard the sound of the door closing behind me that I breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>'...Thank god I made it.'</p><p>My body went limp and my vision turned black after that. Just as I was expecting to hit the stairs in front of me, I felt something soft slowly embrace me as I heard a soft whisper inside of my ears.</p><p>"Thank you for your hard work."</p><p>***</p><p>A week later.</p><p>"Almost everything has been sorted."</p><p>Silug's loud voice echoed out loud as he entered a large hall where a number of figures were seated behind a large oval table made of wood. His gaze was drawn in particular to the individual who was seated at the head of the table.</p><p>He appeared to be rather uninterested in what was going on as he rested his head on his arm which was propped up on the table.</p><p>Sparing Silug a short glance, he asked.</p><p>"Have all the weaker demons been eliminated?"</p><p>"Most have, yes."</p><p>Silug replied in a solemn tone.</p><p>Silug felt an overwhelming sense of reverence and awe as he stared at the figure that was seated at the very end of the table.</p><p>Silug had previously believed that the war was going to mark the end of the orcs, but his presence alone had single-handedly brought an end to the conflict.</p><p>'I never expected that weak human to become so strong...'</p><p>Silug was absolutely convinced by Ren's capabilities.</p><p>The orcs respected the strong and Ren in Silug's eyes was extremely strong.</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>As the silence continued to reign throughout the hall, Ren started making light tapping motions with his finger on the wooden table.</p><p>"…What about the Count and Marquis ranked demons, what are they doing?"</p><p>"Regarding them, they are presently awaiting your instructions outside."</p><p>Silug responded once more, his voice containing even more hints of awe.</p><p>'His decision to have the demons fight amongst themselves is truly worthy of my respect.'</p><p>In essence, by attacking their own kind, they had betrayed their own race. Of course, this was under Ren's threat, but to the demons, this didn't really make a difference.</p><p>Despite the circumstances, the fact that they went against their own kind was unquestionable.</p><p>If the other demons found out about this, there was no question that they would look down on them and scorn them. It was a brilliant move on Ren's part to have them kill members of their own kind, as it would make Ren's plans to have them join his side much simpler.</p><p>After all, if they had nowhere else to go besides staying with Ren who could show them some benefits, it was inevitable that they would accept to be under his authority.</p><p>"Since they have been waiting for me, it is only right that I speak to them. Let them in Silug."</p><p>"As you wish."</p><p>Silug carefully nodded his head.</p><p>Silug behaved like a subordinate in front of Ren despite the fact that he was an orc chief who took great pride in his position.</p><p>It had to be said that Ren's performance over the past few months had truly earned his respect.</p><p>Silug turned around and exited the hall, calling for the demons to enter.</p><p>***</p><p>'I want to go back.'</p><p>The fact that there was so little mana in this world was giving me a headache. Having recently achieved &lt;SS-&gt; rank, the one thing I required most was mana, but this world was lacking in that particular resource.</p><p>It was also important to emphasize the fact that my injuries were still quite severe and that even sitting still caused me a great deal of pain.</p><p>My body required mana in order to recover, but there was a distinct lack of mana in the air, so my recovery time was significantly longer than it ought to have been.</p><p>Despite the fact that I had a mana chamber at my disposal, it was far from enough to satisfy me, as I had depleted the majority of my mana during the fight.</p><p>In addition, considering how difficult and time-consuming it was for me to activate a mana chamber in order to completely replenish my mana supply, my head started to throb intensively.</p><p>'How troublesome…'</p><p>It truly was.</p><p>"Something on your mind, Ren?"</p><p>I suddenly heard Ryan's voice coming from my right.</p><p>When I raised my head to look at Ryan, I was startled to notice that everyone was looking at me at the moment.</p><p>I slouched down on the table and responded in a lazy manner.</p><p>"Nothing much, I was just thinking that I want to go back to earth. Kind of tired of this planet."</p><p>After exchanging looks with the others, Ryan shrugged his shoulders.</p><p>"Sorry to break it to you, but we still have a lot of things to figure out before going back to earth. Firstly, the arrangements regarding the city that you're planning on building, then the demons that—"</p><p>"I know, I know…"</p><p>I let out a deep sigh as I leaned my head back over the table and waved my hand around in an uninterested manner.</p><p>"Ahhh, I want a break."</p><p>"Don't we all."</p><p>Melissa commented from the side.</p><p>Lifting my head slightly, I asked.</p><p>"Did you find what you were looking for?"</p><p>"Nope."</p><p>Melissa shook her head. In spite of the fact that she appeared unruffled, there was evidence of disappointment written all over her face.</p><p>My brows furrowed and a thought occurred to me.</p><p>"Hmmm…I remember that there was a treasury in Azeroth's castle where there were a lot of herbs. In fact, now that we've conquered the whole planet, there's a lot of treasure that we have to collect."</p><p>When I thought about all of the treasures that were in the demon's possession, I noticed that I was finally starting to feel energy enter my body again.</p><p>I couldn't help but feel excited when I thought about all of the treasures that were going to end up in my possession.</p><p>'Just when I thought I was going to be poor once again from this city project.'</p><p>I stood up from my seat and looked at the others.</p><p>"Alright, le—"</p><p>Clank!</p><p>It was precisely at this instant that the doors of the hall suddenly flung open, and a number of individuals entered the space.</p><p>I turned my focus away from the others and toward the demons that had just entered the hall. All expressions on my face quickly vanished.</p><p>"Just in time."</p><p>'Since they are all high ranking demons, they should know which place has the most treasures and where it's located.'</p><p>The thought caused my eyes to sharpen, and without intending to, I let out some of my aura, which had the effect of repressing the demons that were present.</p><p>"I've brought them as you've requested."</p><p>Silug's voice was cracking as he attempted to speak. I didn't bother to look at him, but I did nod my head before sitting back down in my chair.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>While idly resting my head over my hand that was propped up on the table, I swept my gaze over the various demons that were present.</p><p>A silent atmosphere pervaded the area as none of the demons dared to speak.</p><p>I shifted my focus to Silug and inquired.</p><p>"Tell me how many demons each one of them has killed."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p> Silug nodded his head and took out a scroll.</p><p>Evidently, he was prepared.</p><p>"Marquis Rantark, 23,491 demons, Marquis Ivasof, 27, 872, Marquis…"</p><p>I listened to Silug's list, alternating my gaze between the demons whose names were being mentioned.</p><p>They all had a look of submission and defeat plastered across their faces at the moment.</p><p>'They sure did a lot of work.'</p><p>It may have taken a long time, but they certainly eliminated a large number of demons.</p><p>'I guess they care more about their skin than their own kin.'</p><p>With a shrug of the shoulders, I slowly rose from my seat and extended my hand.</p><p>"Count Easkrion, 1,478 demo—"</p><p>"Thank you, Silug."</p><p>I began speaking as I directed my attention toward the demons that were in front of me.</p><p>"Alright, I'm satisfied with what I'm hearing. It seems like you've all obediently accomplished the task that I've assigned you. I'm very happy."</p><p>I clapped my hands once and proceeded to head for the door of the hall.</p><p>"Here's your next task…"</p><p>I stopped as I approached the entrance to the hall. I then mumbled something in a voice that was loud enough for everyone to hear without turning around.</p><p>"Reveal to me the locations of all treasuries located on this planet."</p><p>"...when I mean all, I mean all."</p><p>My eyes narrowed as I rapped on the side of the door, and I let out a whiff of my aura.</p><p>"I've already shown you mercy once. Make sure to treasure your life."</p><p>I immediately left the hall after that.</p><p>'This should be enough.'</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-652.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-654.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

        <p>"What odd power."</p><p>Drawing my attention was the white, viscous film that was coating my hand. The power felt rather gentle, and I sensed no rejection from it.</p><p>At a glance, one wouldn't be able to tell that this power I held was something that far surpassed mana in terms of power.</p><p>"Too bad I don't have a good grasp on it."</p><p>The most I could do with it at the moment was just move it around my hand, albeit extremely slowly.</p><p>I attempted to channel it, but, unlike the mana that flowed freely around my body, the Akashic laws proved to be much more difficult to manipulate than I had anticipated.</p><p>If mana was like water, then the Akashic laws were like peanut butter. It just refused to move forward.</p><p>'Even demonic energy is a lot easier to control than this.'</p><p>I extended my other hand and watched as a black film covered my other hand. The process was smooth, and the black film moved around my hand in a smooth manner.</p><p>"Hm."</p><p>It was right when I was playing with the demonic energy inside of my body that I noticed something.</p><p>"What's this?"</p><p>As I brought my right and left hands closer together, I was surprised to feel a sense of opposition coming from the two powers.</p><p>It was rather weak, but it was there for sure.</p><p>'Are the two of them rejecting each other?'</p><p>I pressed both hands together and closed my eyes to feel whatever was going on.</p><p>It wasn't long before I felt something, and I opened my eyes in surprise.</p><p>'Indeed, it looks like the two powers are rejecting each other.'</p><p>It was very faint, but I could feel it.</p><p>"Inter—huh!?"</p><p>I stopped halfway and hurriedly looked toward my palms. It was there that I noticed the demonic energy pushing back the Akashic laws.</p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p>I immediately grew intrigued and channeled more demonic energy into my right palm.</p><p>Gradually, I watched as the demonic energy pushed the Akashic laws around more and more.</p><p>'What in the...'</p><p>The phenomenon fascinated me, and I understood why this was happening. Compared to the laws, the demonic energy was a lot denser.</p><p>There wasn't a lot of Akashic Laws in my body, as compared to demonic energy, and I had a sudden thought.</p><p>'What if I use demonic energy to help me move the laws better around my body?'</p><p>The concept piqued my interest, and I did not squander any time before putting it into action.</p><p>The results were immediate. The moment that I started channeling the demonic energy inside of my body, the Akashic laws started to move against it. Almost in repulsion, and suddenly, I felt myself getting more and more familiar with this new power.</p><p>I had the urge to release the power at that very moment, but when I thought about a particular possibility, I dismissed the idea.</p><p>I didn't want to blow this place up by accident.</p><p>"Huuu…"</p><p>I stopped channeling my demonic energy and took a deep breath.</p><p>'If only I had a little bit more…'</p><p>The laws that I had in my body… they were still a little too thin for me to control properly. While I indeed found a solution with the demonic energy, it was a little taxing.</p><p>"I think that'll do for today."</p><p>It was more important for me to get more familiar with it before using it again.</p><p>So to avoid any problems.</p><p>'Now…'</p><p>I slowly stood up from the ground. I was currently in a high end training ground—courtesy of the Green Paw Guild.</p><p>I figured this was the best place to train. Due to my unfamiliarity with this new ability, I determined that this was the best location to train in case something went wrong.</p><p>If something truly did happen, I wouldn't really feel guilty about it.</p><p>"Huaaam."</p><p>Covering my mouth, I stretched my back.</p><p>Ding—!</p><p>A sudden notification stopped me, and I turned to look at my watch. When I pressed the message, I noticed it contained a file.</p><p>[ACCO.txt]</p><p>'They are truly a lot more efficient than I gave them credit for.'</p><p>I tapped on the file, and several files appeared on my watch. I carefully read through them, not missing a single sentence.</p><p>"Huh."</p><p>Going through each and every one of the files didn't take me very long at all. About an hour, and by the time I was finished, I wasn't sure how to react.</p><p>There was a lot more information than I expected.</p><p>I felt complicated, but…</p><p>"I think I know how to get back now."</p><p>***</p><p>It was a delightful day in Ashton city. The sun hung in the sky, illuminating all that was beneath, and a gentle breeze accompanied the light.</p><p>In a certain park.</p><p>"You're quite a hard man to find."</p><p>My gaze fell on a certain man. On one of the park benches, he was scattering bread crumbs towards a small flock of pigeons.</p><p>Bobbing their heads up and down, they wrestled and tackled each other to get to the crumbs.</p><p>"Have you found the answer that you were looking for?"</p><p>"More or less."</p><p>I sat down on the same bench.</p><p>"May I?"</p><p>"Go ahead."</p><p> Seeing how he was enjoying himself while feeding the pigeons, I decided to give it a try myself.</p><p>I scooped up a few of the crumbs and flung them in the direction of the birds. By the time it took me to blink, the crumbs were already gone.</p><p>"It's rather calming, eh?"</p><p>"You call this calming?"</p><p>I handed him the bag back. This wasn't for me.</p><p>"Not a fan?"</p><p>Matthew took the bag and then continued to feed the pigeons. It looked like he was having a good time.</p><p>"What are you going to do next?"</p><p>He asked while keeping his eyes on the pigeons.</p><p>I took a moment to muse over my thoughts before leaning back on the bench.</p><p>"Although I've found a clue, I don't know whether it's the right clue. I'd have to check back to my world to check the validity of it."</p><p>"Mhm."</p><p>Matthew threw a handful of crumbs to the pigeons. His expression was rather hard to read.</p><p>"Does that mean that you want to go back?"</p><p>"I can go back?"</p><p>I was surprised by the sudden revelation. Could I finally go back to my own world?</p><p>"You can go back."</p><p>Matthew repeated, reassuring me that I didn't hear incorrectly. I immediately found myself getting excited at the words.</p><p>'No, wait.'</p><p>But I was quick to calm myself down.</p><p>'While I do want to go back home, it's still too early…'</p><p>Thinking about a few things, I found myself calming down considerably. There were still a couple of things I needed to get done here.</p><p>"So? Do you want to go back?"</p><p>Hearing Matthew's voice, I turned to face him. I found myself pursing my lips.</p><p>"…How long can I stay in this world?"</p><p>"You want to stay?"</p><p>Matthew appeared quite surprised by my words, as he raised his eyebrows and stopped feeding the pigeons.</p><p>Loosening his hand, the crumbs fell through the gap between his fingers.</p><p>"Why do you want to stay? I thought you wanted to go back... I want to remind you that the people here are not the same people you know. This world… It's not your world, nor is it real."</p><p>"Well…"</p><p>I smiled and stared at my hand.</p><p>"…Real or not real, it doesn't really matter to me. While the people of this world are so much weaker than those of my world, there's still a lot that I can learn from them."</p><p>The three Grandmasters.</p><p>They were indeed a lot weaker than I currently was. That being said, in the few short instances where I had the pleasure of learning from them, I understood that their mastery over the sword was far greater than mine.</p><p>There was so much that I could learn from them, and leaving such an opportunity behind did indeed feel like a pity.</p><p>"That is, of course, granted by the fact that the time I spend here is faster than my world. If time flows the same, then I guess I have no choice but to go back."</p><p>The war with the Monolith might've been over, but that was merely the start of the true war that was about to come.</p><p>I couldn't afford to waste time.</p><p>"You don't have to worry about that."</p><p>Matthew smiled.</p><p>"Kevin has already made the necessary preparations. If you want to stay, you can stay… Just that I don't know for how long you can stay for."</p><p>He raised his head to stare at the sky.</p><p>"Perhaps a couple of days? A week? …Perhaps even a month, I'm not sure, but when the time comes, I'm sure you'll know."</p><p>"That's… enough."</p><p>Honestly, it was a bit less than I wanted, but it was just about enough. I knew from the very beginning that I was merely a 'visitor' of this world and that I'd soon leave it.</p><p>"Well, that's great."</p><p>Matthew patted his hands and stood up.</p><p>"Once you're done, you can find me again. I'll be in this park."</p><p>"Got it."</p><p>Nodding my head, I watched him leave and heaved a long sigh.</p><p>"I guess I should make do with the time I have."</p><p>For I knew that the moment I returned to my world, it'd be the same moment I entered hell.</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-750.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-752.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

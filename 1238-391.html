        <p>'What happened to me?'</p><p>I don't quite remember. My mind was hazy, and my body hurt all over.</p><p>"Haaa…"</p><p>I breathed out, and my eyes slowly opened up.</p><p>The first thing I saw once I opened my eyes, was the full moon hanging in the sky. Next to it were the millions of stars sorrounding it.</p><p>'Beautiful'</p><p>I thought.</p><p>Alone in the sky surrounded by many different stars, a deep sense of tranquility enshrouded my mind.</p><p>"You back to normal?"</p><p>It was faint, but I could hear a familiar voice next to my ears.</p><p>I turned my head, and my eyes soon paused on a figure. Leaning against a broken tree, with his arm on his knee, Kevin looked at me.</p><p>"Looks like you've recovered."</p><p>A fait smile hung on his face.</p><p>'Ah…'</p><p>It was then that fragments of memories started flooding my mind, and I was able to understand what had just happened.</p><p>Without saying anything, I covered my face with my arm and proceeded to turn my head back to its previous position.</p><p>'I lost it.'</p><p>I knew that there was going to be a chance that I would lose myself when confronting Aaron. It was also because of this that I chose to handle the situation as quickly as possible.</p><p>Rather than losing myself then, in front of everyone and the Union, I would've rather have lost myself alone, but…</p><p>'Why were they here? How could they suddenly show up out of nowhere?'</p><p>They weren't supposed to be here.</p><p>They weren't supposed to see me in this state...</p><p>"Are you not going to say anything?"</p><p>Kevin's voice sounded once again.</p><p>I wanted to say something. I wanted to tell him a lot of things...but the words just wouldn't come out of my mouth.</p><p>"We haven't seen each other for over three years. Everyone here thought you were dead…and the first time we see you again, you suddenly go into this crazy rampage…"</p><p>Kevin's words sounded calm. But, as I laid on the ground with my eyes closed, I could feel the sadness hidden within his voice.</p><p>'Why is he sad?'</p><p>I wondered as my chest stung.</p><p>Does he perhaps feel betrayed by what I did? Disillusioned that I was not the same Ren that he previously knew? Maybe.</p><p>Silence enveloped the surroundings.</p><p>"…You really don't have anything to say?"</p><p>Kevin asked as he disrupted the silence.</p><p>I shook my head.</p><p>What did I have to say? Do I tell them that I'm broken?…That the me that they used to know was no longer there?</p><p>'I…I don't know what to do.'</p><p>"I somewhat know how you're feeling."</p><p>His words made my brows furrow slightly.</p><p>Moving my arm down, I peeked through the narrow gap.</p><p>Letting out a deep sigh, Kevin lifted his head and stared at the moon in the sky.</p><p>"Haa…Ren…I've got many things that I want to say to you…but…"</p><p>Lowering his head, our eyes met. He smiled faintly.</p><p>"…I'm just glad that you're okay."</p><p>"Ah…"</p><p>My lips trembled, and my eyes started to hurt. Covering my eyes once again, I tried to hold myself back…but it was hard.</p><p>What I've been through. The loneliness and pain I felt when I was suddenly thrown into the Monolith.</p><p>Just when I thought that things couldn't have been worse, I was forced to become a fugitive and had to escape the human domain.</p><p>It was then that the loneliness inside of my heart increased. I started to realize, that maybe…just maybe…the world was trying to tell me something.</p><p>'You don't belong here.'</p><p>And maybe the world was right. At first, I thought that it was just me…but with each passing day, the idea started to take more and more semblance inside of my mind, until finally, I thought, 'Maybe I truly don't belong here.'</p><p>Once the idea sprouted, despite my many attempts at trying to not think about it, it continued to grow inside of my mind.</p><p>It wasn't long before that was what I thought each night when I went to sleep.</p><p>The times I thought of killing myself, trying to numb myself from the pain that I was undergoing each day.</p><p>I thought that maybe I really didn't deserve to be here, but…</p><p>'…I'm just glad that you're okay.'</p><p>Those words.</p><p>They were simple words, yet, the moment Kevin said them, it felt as though someone stabbed me straight into the heart. His words pierced harder than a dagger ever could, and my emotions stirred once again.</p><p>"Say, are you crying?"</p><p>Kevin's voice sounded once again. This time, it was a lot closer.</p><p>"Hey…are you really crying for what I said?"</p><p>My brows knit as I heard his voice. The previous emotions that I felt numbed down, and what replaced them was annoyance.</p><p>"Heee…you really did cry..."</p><p>Sensing the subtle teasing tone hidden within his voice, my mouth twitched.</p><p>The annoyance within me grew even more and before I knew it, my mouth opened.</p><p>"Fuck off."</p><p>"…ha? Did you just tell me to fuck off?"</p><p>"I did. The tone of your voice pisses me off."</p><p>"Wha—"</p><p>"You finally understand how I feel whenever I hear your voice."</p><p>It was then that, cutting Kevin off, I heard another familiar voice. Without even seeing who spoke, I could tell who the voice belonged to.</p><p>Melissa.</p><p>Who other than her would ever say those words?</p><p>"I kind of already knew the feeling before."</p><p>I replied back.</p><p>"You did?"</p><p>"Yeah, after all, I used to talk to you."</p><p>A brief moment of silence ensued after I said those words. Of course, the silence did not last for long as I soon heard the sound of sleeves being pulled upwards.</p><p>"…alright."</p><p>"Wait, Melissa stop! Stop!"</p><p>Kevin's panicked voice sounded. I didn't even need to look to understand what was happening.</p><p>"Let me go, Kevin! As you can see, he's still not in the right state of mind. I need to give him an extra dosage. One…no, he needs ten more before he finally recover—"</p><p>"Pfttt…"</p><p>Before I knew it, my stomach started to tingle and my moth trembled. I suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>"Hahahahaha."</p><p>"Oh look, great. He's completely lost it."</p><p>Melissa's voice rang amidst my fit of laughter.</p><p>Removing my arm away from my face and propping my body against a tree behind me, I finally got to see a closer look at everyone present.</p><p>They had changed a lot. Compared to the last time I saw them, when they looked a lot more childish, the people in front of me had now fully matured.</p><p>Finally letting go of Melissa, a relieved look appeared on Kevin's face as he said.</p><p>"I'm glad you're feeling better."</p><p>I could feel the genuine relief in his voice as he said those words, and I smiled as a result.</p><p>"…ukh."</p><p>But just as I was about to speak, I suddenly felt a sharp pain by the side of my chest. Lowering my head, I rubbed the area that was hurting.</p><p>"Ren, are you okay?"</p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p>Reassuring Kevin, I unbuttoned my shirt to get a closer look at my injuries.</p><p>Taking off my shirt and taking a closer look at my body, my brows jumped up slightly.</p><p>"No wonder it hurts."</p><p>A large blue bruise traced from the right side of my ribs to the bottom part of my chest.</p><p>'This was probably from Amanda's arrow.'</p><p>The memory was faint, but I could definitely tell that this was because of Amanda's last shot that hit me directly in the ribs.</p><p>Touching it slightly, I flinched.</p><p>"Fuck that hurts!"</p><p>Taking a potion from my dimensional space, I quickly chugged it down. Slowly, the wounds started to heal, and the pain slowly subsided.</p><p>Once I took the potion, lifting my head, I noticed everyone staring at me.</p><p>Surprise flashed across my face.</p><p>"Hm? What are you guys looking at?"</p><p>Raising his hand, Kevin pointed it towards my body.</p><p>"Ren, you…"</p><p>"Oh, right I forgot."</p><p>Realization suddenly dawned on me, as I scratched the back of my head.</p><p>'Right, I'm currently shirtless. How careless of me.'</p><p>Grabbing my shirt, I put it back on.</p><p>As I was putting it on, I tried to apologize to the others.</p><p>"Sorry, I completely forg—"</p><p>Right as I was buttoning my shirt back, a hand grasped my wrist. Turning my head, I found Amanda next to me. Her eyes locked onto my body.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>I asked. But she promptly ignored me. Extending her hand, she took my shirt away.</p><p>"Oy!"</p><p>Startled by her sudden action, I looked up, but when I did, the words that were about to say became stuck.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>With an indifferent look, Amanda just stared at my body.</p><p>At first, I found her behavior odd, but when I looked at her and looked into her black eyes, I could see a rare display of emotion hidden deep within them. I saw that same look before...but I just couldn't quite remember when.</p><p>Standing up, Amanda turned her back against me. Seemingly trying to hide her expression away from me and the others.</p><p>'Why is she reacting like that?'</p><p>I wondered to myself, staring at her back from where I was.</p><p> Turning my head and seeing the others who displayed similar odd reactions, I looked down, towards my body, and it was then that I finally realized why everyone was reacting so strangely.</p><p>Without saying anything, grabbing my shirt, I quickly buttoned it up and stood up.</p><p>Scratching the back of my head, I tried to play it off.</p><p>"Haha, surprised by how much I've changed?"</p><p>Walking up to them, I shrugged my shoulders.</p><p>"Don't worry about those. I can get them removed anytime. They are nothing major."</p><p>"Pleas…e stop lying."</p><p>It was soft. Almost inaudible. But when I heard those words, my feet came to a sudden halt.</p><p>Turning my head, I looked at Amanda who still had her back turned on me. Her shoulders trembling a little.</p><p>Biting my tongue, I forced a smile.</p><p>"It's fine. What you saw were just scars I got from my training. They aren't anything worth being wo—"</p><p>"Ren, stop."</p><p>A hand pressed against my shoulder. It was Kevin.</p><p>Shaking his head, Kevin had a complicated look on his face as he looked at me.</p><p>"I won't ask you to tell us what you've gone through…but, please, stop trying to pretend that you're alright when you're not."</p><p>"Stop pretending?"</p><p>"Yes. Stop pretending to be someone you're not."</p><p>Staring in Amanda's direction before turning to look at the others, I let out a long breath.</p><p>"Huuu."</p><p>Lifting my head, I stared at the sky.</p><p>'Stop pretending…When was the last time that I've done that?'</p><p>The last time I acted like my true self?...was there ever a time?</p><p>Thinking about it, I have never ever been my true self. I always wore a mask to hide my real feelings.</p><p>The reason why was obvious, no?</p><p>As the leader of the group, I couldn't show them their weak side. Who would follow a broken leader?</p><p>No one.</p><p>Even with my parents, I had to pretend to be someone else as I had taken the body of their real son.</p><p>Even at the Lock, I always pretended to be this weak extra and accepted the abuse from the others just so that I wouldn't have to expose myself.</p><p>Was there ever a time when I did not pretend for once?</p><p>Closing my eyes, memories flashed inside of my mind. From the happy times to the sad times, I started to recall everything.</p><p>They say someone remembers their saddest moments more vividly than their happiest ones.</p><p>It was only now that I finally understood what they meant.</p><p>Out of all the memories that I tried to recall, most of them were made up with sad ones.</p><p>"You don't have to pretend to be someone you're not when you're with me. I won't judge you for that."</p><p>Kevin's words powerfully rang inside of my mind as I opened my eyes again.</p><p>"Haaa...haaa..."</p><p>Breathing out a couple of times, I tried to suppress the inner turmoil inside of my head before finally, mustering every little bit of strength inside of my body, I muttered.</p><p>"Pl..ease help me."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-390.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-392.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>

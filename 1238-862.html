        <p>Epilogue — The Author's POV</p><p>"Jezebeth's movements became calculated and precise, his attacks aimed not just at causing damage, but also at creating distractions and openings. He maneuvered with finesse, avoiding lethal strikes by the slimmest of margins and countering with all the strength he could muster. Every strike he landed served to weaken his opponents and sow seeds of doubt in their minds..."</p><p>A soft voice echoed within the confines of a small room. Soft pastel hues adorned the walls of the room, creating a soothing atmosphere while the air was filled with the delicate scent of lavender.</p><p>"Having just ascended to Duke rank, Jezebeth shed the cloak of insignificance. Though not yet the epitome of strength, he steadily ascended toward that pinnacle. With an unwavering determination, he set his sights on a lofty goal, impervious to any obstacles, even those who dared stand in his path. No one could stop him."</p><p>Settling himself comfortably in a plush armchair, the man's warm and inviting voice captivated the attention of the two children nestled in the bed before him. The two pair of blue eyes blinked with anticipation as they eagerly listened to the story.</p><p>Soft lamplight illuminated the room, casting a cozy glow that enveloped them all. The sight was a very warm one.</p><p>"Jezebeth smiled softly as he stared at the four figures that stood before him, his calm gaze settling over each and every one of them. 'I get it, hunting demons is fun. I previously didn't understand why you'd try to hunt us. Is it really that fun? What's so fun about hunting those weaker than you when they've done nothing to you?'"</p><p>"But he soon nodded his head and spoke. 'I didn't quite understand it back then, but now I do.' He pressed his hand forward, and the expression of the four individuals changed dramatically. But it was already too late as the space around them showed signs of distortion. 'Hunting,' Jezebeth licked his lips, his hand twisting in one motion. 'Is a lot more fun than I thought.'"</p><p>"Waaah!"</p><p>"So cool."</p><p>The children opened their eyes in astonishment. They were both about five years of age, and their cute little faces couldn't help but twinkle with excitement at the story that was being told to them.</p><p>"What happens next!"</p><p>"Dad, don't stop!"</p><p>Their hearts beat with excitement as they looked at their father with a certain level of eagerness. Sadly for them, their father shook his head.</p><p>"I'm sorry, but that's about it for today."</p><p>"Wahhh, no!"</p><p>"Nooo, I want more!"</p><p>The children protested, but there was nothing the father could do. Lowering his head and staring at the empty pages in front of him which were slowly being filled with words, he could only sigh.</p><p>The story was still writing itself. He could only stop where the story had stopped.</p><p>Eventually, the blank pages would fill, and he'd be able to continue where he left off.</p><p>"Hmph! Dad is being a meanie!"</p><p>The children pouted, and a helpless smile appeared on their father's face. He was truly helpless on this matter.</p><p>"It's already late, and you guys need to sleep. I'll read you the story next time. I promise."</p><p>"Well... okay."</p><p>The two children weren't unreasonable. After a little coaxing, they settled back on the bed and closed their eyes. A gentle smile appeared on the father's face as he stared at the two of them, and just as he was about to leave, a soft voice echoed in the air.</p><p>"Dad."</p><p>"Hm? What is it Lyla?"</p><p>When he turned around, he found his daughter staring at him with a hint of curiosity in her deep blue eyes that resembled his own.</p><p>"How long is left of the story?"</p><p>Surprised by the question, the father lowered his head to stare at the book in his hands before slowly closing it and placing it on the table next to him.</p><p>"There's still a lot left to the story."</p><p>"A lot left?"</p><p>Lyla's eyes widened.</p><p>"But... isn't Jezebeth about to become the strongest soon?"</p><p>"He is..." He answered, gently caressing the cover of the book. "But there's still so much to tell, and characters to meet. The story is still at its beginning stages."</p><p>"Uh."</p><p>Lyla blinked her eyes a couple of times, seemingly having a hard time understanding her father's words.</p><p>"Then... Jezebeth isn't the main character?"</p><p>"Well, that depends on how you see things," he answered, musing over his words. "A main character is a central character who we experience the story through. In a way, you can say everyone is their own main character. It just depends on your perspective.

        <p>From the moment the scenery around me changed, and I found myself back in Ashton City, I came to the realization that I wasn't transported out into the nothingness of space like I previously thought I was.</p><p>Instead, it seemed like I was placed inside a different dimension created by Waylan, governed by the Laws.</p><p>His words confirmed it shortly afterward.</p><p>Despite my lack of knowledge about the inner workings of this space I was in, I realized that the only way to properly fight back was through the laws themselves.</p><p>...and I did.</p><p>I summoned a part of the laws that I had, and I successfully managed to stop him. I was successful in injuring him, but it came at a cost.</p><p>'I'm already gassed out.'</p><p>My body was practically shaking as I struggled to channel the energy inside of me.</p><p>I thought I had prepared enough, but it was clear that I wasn't prepared for what was to come.</p><p>I was already gassed out, and my energy was rapidly depleting.</p><p>"You…"</p><p>Waylan noticed the injury in his body, and his expression changed. At first, he seemed mad, but for some reason, he kept his cool, and the injury slowly started to recede. I frowned as I realized that what I had done wasn't enough.</p><p>But Waylan spoke.</p><p>"That was a very good attempt."</p><p>His nonchalant voice reverberated through the air, and it was followed by a violent thrust of wind that headed my way.</p><p>WIIIIIING―! The world around me bent, and I saw the tips of a skyscraper heading straight for me. I narrowly dodged it and shifted my attention to the approaching fist.</p><p>It grew larger in my vision by the second, and before I knew it, it was just an inch away from my nose. I summoned all the strength I had left and opened my mouth.</p><p>"Stop."</p><p>Golden runes and words popped out from the space around the fist and clamped onto them. The fist stopped in its tracks and started trembling.</p><p>"Ugh."</p><p>I could feel my body weaken at the usage of the Laws, but I clenched my teeth and pushed through the pain.</p><p>Swoosh―! I took advantage of the little time I bought to move to the side and avoid the fist. I followed up with my own kick, aimed directly at Waylan's neck.</p><p>But it felt like I hit hard metal, and I felt an intense pain coming directly from my shin.</p><p>Despite the pain, I managed to push Waylan back. I grabbed my sword and took a deep breath. I knew what I had to do next. I summoned all the energy I had left and prepared for the third movement of the [Keiki Style]: Void Step.</p><p>My vision blurred, and I reappeared in front of Waylan. I heard a familiar clicking sound as my sword hit something, and Waylan's body shot back even further.</p><p>"Haaa... haa..."</p><p>I was panting heavily, but I gritted my teeth and repeated the same movement.</p><p>The third movement of the [Keiki Style]: Void Step.</p><p>I could feel my mana rapidly deteriorating with each movement, but I persevered and continued.</p><p>The third movement of the [Keiki Style]: Void Step.</p><p>The third movement of the [Keiki Style]: Void Step.</p><p>The third movement of the [Keiki Style]: Void Step.</p><p>With each attack, I appeared in front of Waylan, determined to take him down. I tried to inflict as much damage as possible on him by employing anything at my disposal, whether it was my sword or any part of my body.</p><p>The slightest movement felt like it would bring on excruciating pain, and I could feel my muscles tearing as a result of the enormous strain that was being placed on my body.</p><p>However, with the assistance of the demonic energy that was residing within my body, I was able to push through the pain and keep attacking with everything that I had.</p><p>'Yeah... the pain is nothing... I'm far too used to this...'</p><p>Pain was the one thing I was capable of enduring, and with that knowledge in mind, I continued to put forth as much strain on my body as I possibly could.</p><p>WIIING―!</p><p>The space in front of me crumbled, and Waylan's body shot into the distance.</p><p>As I pressed my hand against the empty space next to me, the mana that was normally stored within my body began to drain at an alarming rate, and I came dangerously close to passing out right then and there.</p><p>However, I gritted my teeth and persevered through the excruciating pain as a barely perceptible ripple began to spread across the surface of the sky.</p><p>"What are you trying to do?"</p><p>My ears picked up Waylan's voice coming from my right, and when I turned my head to look in that direction, I could see him standing a few meters away from me.</p><p>The moment he appeared, my heart sank, and before I had even a chance to react, I felt something press against my chest, and I crashed into the city below.</p><p>BANG―!</p><p>The pain traveled throughout my back, and I found it difficult to breathe as a result of the sheer impact of the collision.</p><p>"Aph!"</p><p>It wasn't until I took a loud gulp of air that I noticed the darkness that had begun to creep into the peripheries of my vision, beginning to fade away.</p><p>"What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>Waylan's voice sounded from above, and when I looked up, I saw him hovering in the area above me. His back was turned to the backdrop of Ashton City, which was inching closer and closer to him.</p><p>"Like I've said before. Everything that is within this area is under my direct control. Put an end to whatever futile sense of resistance you have, and just…"</p><p>When he opened his hand, his body phased, and I saw the skyline of Ashton City come into view and head my way at incredible speeds.</p><p>The most notable thing was the tip of the Union Tower, which was aimed my way directly.</p><p>Lying in the middle of the road, I watched as the tip of the tower inched its way closer to me. Clenching my teeth, I used everything that was left in me to force myself up and press my hand against my sword.</p><p>Click―!</p><p>At that precise moment, all of my strength left me, and I felt as though my legs were going to give out from under me; however, I was still able to accomplish what I set out to do.</p><p>Crash―!</p><p>Following a soft clicking sound, the area in front of me began to collapse, and the Ashton City that was heading my way collapsed into fine shards, revealing a cloudless blue sky where Waylan was standing behind.</p><p>His starry eyes were directed at me, and an unfathomable pressure bore down on me.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>My legs gave out under the strain, and I fell to the ground, unable to hold on any longer.</p><p>"Pftt."</p><p>I tried to stop whatever was trying to escape my mouth by covering it with my hand, but it was too late, and when I looked down, I saw streaks of my own blood on the ground beneath me.</p><p>"It's over."</p><p>When I looked up at Waylan, I saw that he was staring at me with a look of complete disinterest, and his voice seemed to be coming from everywhere at once. It was as if he were dealing with a relatively insignificant bug.</p><p>I couldn't help but laugh when he looked at me, and after I took my hand away from my mouth, I leaned back against the ground and stared at him.</p><p>"Have you finally given up?"</p><p>His voice reached my ears once more.</p><p>"What makes you think that?"</p><p>"…So you haven't?"</p><p>"Hmm."</p><p>I cocked my head to the side and smiled faintly, staring at the faint ripple next to him. The one that I had planted moments before falling back into the city.</p><p>"I guess not."</p><p> Rumble―! Rumble―! Almost immediately after uttering those words, the space around Waylan began to twist and turn, and a large sword projection emerged from a crack that had formed in the space next to him. </p><p>The sudden situation surprised Waylan, who looked at the sword in shock, but it was already too late.</p><p>The sword emerged from the fissure in a very gradual manner, exposing approximately three quarters of its body, and the space showed signs of breaking apart.</p><p>"Sixth movement."</p><p>I mustered the strength to utter a few words as I extended my hand to cover both the sword and the figure of Waylan.</p><p>Almost immediately after that, everything came crashing down, and a deafening sound spread throughout the area around me.</p><p>WOOOOOOOOONG―!</p><p>The sixth movement…</p><p>A movement that I had been trying to perfect for a very long time.</p><p>I was close, yet still far from reaching the end of it. I thought I managed to grasp it, but it was only three quarters of it, but it was enough.</p><p>Still... it was the best that I had.</p><p>My most powerful move, and sure enough, the power I felt from it sent shivers down my spine, and as I exploded in front of me.</p><p>BANG―! BANG―!</p><p>The aftermath of the attack sent me flying and stumbling across the ground until I finally came to a stop next to a building.</p><p>Crash―! As I slammed into the building, I felt completely immobile. I no longer felt any energy within my body, and the darkness that had begun to seep into my vision a few moments prior began to expand, slowly consuming my entire vision.</p><p>"Di…d I do it?"</p><p>I wondered to myself, trying to see the result of my attack in the distance. But it was clear that I wouldn't be able to see it as my vision started to darken completely.</p><p>That was until I heard a certain voice.</p><p>A void that I never thought I'd hear again…</p><p>"No."</p><p>My vision immediately cleared upon hearing that voice.</p><p>"You didn't do it."</p><br><p><span class="btn-group" role="group" aria-label="Basic outlined example"><a href="1238-761.html?dark=false&size=16" id="backBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Back</a><a href="1238-763.html?dark=false&size=16" id="nextBottom" type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">Next</a></span></p>
